	abstract = {Splicing of pre-mRNA is a critical step in mRNA maturation and disturbances cause several genetic disorders. We apply the synthetic tetracycline (tc)-binding riboswitch to establish a gene expression system for conditional tc-dependent control of pre-mRNA splicing in yeast. Efficient regulation is obtained when the aptamer is inserted close to the 5′splice site (SS) with the consensus sequence of the SS located within the aptamer stem. Structural probing indicates limited spontaneous cleavage within this stem in the absence of the ligand. Addition of tc leads to tightening of the stem and the whole aptamer structure which probably prevents recognition of the 5′SS. Combination of more then one aptamer-regulated intron increases the extent of regulation leading to highly efficient conditional gene expression systems. Our findings highlight the potential of direct RNA–ligand interaction for regulation of gene expression.},

Each of the CPs is similar to 1 of the 2 matrices derived in the work of Miyazawa and Jernigan (Proteins 1999;34:49–68). The CP matrices of the first class can be approximated with a correlation of order 0.9 by the formula eij = hi + hj, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 20, where the residue-type dependent factor h is highly correlated with the frequency of occurrence of a given amino acid type inside proteins. Electrostatic interactions for the potentials of this class are almost negligible. In the potentials belonging to this class, the major contribution to the potentials is the one-body transfer energy of the amino acid from water to the protein environment. Potentials belonging to the second class can be approximated with a correlation of 0.9 by the formula eij = c0 − hihj + qiqj, where c0 is a constant, h is highly correlated with the Kyte–Doolittle hydrophobicity scale, and a new, less dominant, residue-type dependent factor q is correlated ({\textasciitilde}0.9) with amino acid isoelectric points pI. Including electrostatic interactions significantly improves the approximation for this class of potentials. While, the high correlation between potentials of the first class and the hydrophobic transfer energies is well known, the fact that this approximation can work well also for the second class of potentials is a new finding. We interpret potentials of this class as representing energies of contact of amino acid pairs within an average protein environment. Proteins 2005;59:49–57.},

Phosphate is essential for all living systems, serving as a building block of genetic and metabolic machinery. However, it is unclear how phosphate could have assumed these central roles on primordial Earth, given its poor geochemical accessibility. We used systems biology approaches to explore the alternative hypothesis that a protometabolism could have emerged prior to the incorporation of phosphate. Surprisingly, we identified a cryptic phosphate-independent core metabolism producible from simple prebiotic compounds. This network is predicted to support the biosynthesis of a broad category of key biomolecules. Its enrichment for enzymes utilizing iron-sulfur clusters, and the fact that thermodynamic bottlenecks are more readily overcome by thioester rather than phosphate couplings, suggest that this network may constitute a “metabolic fossil” of an early phosphate-free nonenzymatic biochemistry. Our results corroborate and expand previous proposals that a putative thioester-based metabolism could have predated the incorporation of phosphate and an RNA-based genetic system.

	abstract = {Enzymes use protein architecture to impose specific electrostatic fields onto their bound substrates, but the magnitude and catalytic effect of these electric fields have proven difficult to quantify with standard experimental approaches. Using vibrational Stark effect spectroscopy, we found that the active site of the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) exerts an extremely large electric field onto the C=O chemical bond that undergoes a charge rearrangement in KSI’s rate-determining step. Moreover, we found that the magnitude of the electric field exerted by the active site strongly correlates with the enzyme’s catalytic rate enhancement, enabling us to quantify the fraction of the catalytic effect that is electrostatic in origin. The measurements described here may help explain the role of electrostatics in many other enzymes and biomolecular systems.
Stark influence on reaction rates
Enzymes accelerate chemical processes by coaxing molecules into just the right reactive states. Fried et al. now elucidate the way the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase pushes its substrate toward product through exertion of a local electric field (see the Perspective by Hildebrandt). First the authors calibrated the shifts in molecular vibrational frequencies, known as Stark shifts, that fields of varying strength impose on a substrate analog; then they measured the vibrational spectrum of that compound in the enzyme's active site. The experiment uncovered an unusually strong field that the local enzyme structure directed to the precise spot where the substrate would react.

Aptamers are nucleic acids that bind their cognate ligands (ranging from metal ions to small molecules to proteins) specifically and tightly. Through rational design and/or directed evolution, aptamers can be engineered into allosteric nucleic acids whose conformations can be regulated by their ligands. Aptamer beacons, aptazymes, and riboswitches all undergo ligand-dependent conformational changes, and have been adapted to signal the concentration of their ligands. However, there is currently no model that can be used to predict how the energetics of conformational change affects signaling, either in vitro or in vivo. We have developed a model that identifies what parameters can be optimized to best yield signals. By focusing on these parameters, it should be possible to more readily design or select more effective conformation-switching nucleic acid biosensors.},

It is also possible that, when entering marriage themselves, adults whose parents divorced have less personal relationship commitment to their own marriages and less confidence in their own ability to maintain a happy marriage with their spouse. However, this prediction has not been tested. In the current study, we assessed relationship commitment and relationship confidence, as well as parental divorce and retrospectively-reported interparental conflict, in a sample of 265 engaged couples prior to their first marriage. Results demonstrated that women’s but not men’s parental divorce was associated with lower relationship commitment and lower relationship confidence. These effects persisted when controlling for the influence of recalled interparental conflict and premarital relationship adjustment. The current findings suggest that women whose parents divorced are more likely to enter marriage with relatively lower commitment to, and confidence in, the future of those marriages, potentially raising their risk for divorce.},

	abstract = {The ability to generate RNA aptamers for synthetic biology using in vitro selection depends on the informational complexity (IC) needed to specify functional structures that bind target ligands with desired affinities in physiological concentrations of magnesium. We investigate how selection for high-affinity aptamers is constrained by chemical properties of the ligand and the need to bind in low magnesium. We select two sets of RNA aptamers that bind planar ligands with dissociation constants (Kds) ranging from 65 nM to 100 μM in physiological buffer conditions. Aptamers selected to bind the non-proteinogenic amino acid, p-amino phenylalanine (pAF), are larger and more informationally complex (i.e., rarer in a pool of random sequences) than aptamers selected to bind a larger fluorescent dye, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR). Interestingly, tighter binding aptamers show less dependence on magnesium than weaker-binding aptamers. Thus, selection for high-affinity binding may automatically lead to structures that are functional in physiological conditions (1–2.5 mM Mg2+). We hypothesize that selection for high-affinity binding in physiological conditions is primarily constrained by ligand characteristics such as molecular weight (MW) and the number of rotatable bonds. We suggest that it may be possible to estimate aptamer–ligand affinities and predict whether a particular aptamer-based design goal is achievable before performing the selection.},

We show that approximately one-third of all known protein structures contain an energetically stabilizing Met-aromatic motif and, remarkably, that greater than 10,000 structures contain this motif more than 10 times. Critically, we show that as compared with a purely hydrophobic interaction, the Met-aromatic motif yields an additional stabilization of 1-1.5 kcal/mol. To highlight its importance and to dissect the energetic underpinnings of this motif, we have studied two clinically relevant TNF ligand-receptor complexes, namely TRAIL-DR5 and LTα-TNFR1. In both cases, we show that the motif is necessary for high affinity ligand binding as well as function. Additionally, we highlight previously overlooked instances of the motif in several disease-related Met mutations.

An orthogonal approach is to probe for 'response signatures' that identify specific circuit motifs. For example, bistability, hysteresis, or irreversibility are used to detect positive feedback loops. For adapting systems, such signatures are not known. Only two circuit motifs generate adaptation: negative feedback loops (NFLs) and incoherent feed-forward loops (IFFLs). On the basis of computational testing and mathematical proofs, we propose differential signatures: in response to oscillatory stimulation, NFLs but not IFFLs show refractory–period stabilization (robustness to changes in stimulus duration) or period skipping. Applying this approach to yeast, we identified the circuit dominating cell cycle timing. In Caenorhabditis elegans AWA neurons, which are crucial for chemotaxis, we uncovered a Ca2+ NFL leading to adaptation that would be difficult to find by other means. These response signatures allow direct access to the outlines of the wiring diagrams of adapting systems.},

This ‘slip structure’ model in which alternative sets of base-pairs are formed in the absence and presence of ligand proved amenable to energetic and computational modeling. Initial successes in modeling the activities of known aptazymes led to the in silico selection of new ligand-dependent aptazymes from virtual pools that contained millions of members. Those aptazymes that were predicted to best fit the slip structure model were synthesized and assayed, and the best-designed aptazyme was activated 60-fold by FMN. The slip structure model proved to be generalizable, and could be applied with equal facility to computationally generate aptazymes that proved to be experimentally activated by other ligands (theophylline) or that contained other catalytic cores (hairpin ribozyme). Moreover, the slip structure model could be applied to the prediction of a ligand-dependent aptamer beacon biosensor in which the addition of the protein vascular endothelial growth factor (VegF) led to a 10-fold increase in fluorescent signal.},

The ability to create vast combinatorial libraries of random RNA sequences has previously been exploited in vitro to identify RNA aptamers with desirable binding specificities, and to isolate RNAs with novel catalytic properties. Despite the advantages of in vitro selections from RNA libraries, there is no way to predict if the identified RNAs can function in living cells. We are therefore exploring random RNA expression libraries in Escherichia coli to search for small RNAs with novel functions. Here we describe selections that identified a small RNA (∼260 nucleotides) capable of altering the copy-number control circuitry of IncFII plasmids. The novel RNA appears to function by annealing to a region of the mRNA encoding the plasmid replicator protein. The resulting RNA-RNA hybrid permits translation of the replicator protein, but blocks base-pairing with a natural negative regulatory RNA. Implications of this in vivo selection strategy are discussed.},

While most trans-acting ncRNAs possess well-defined mechanisms that can regulate transcription or translation, they generally lack the ability to directly sense cellular signals. In this work, we describe a set of design principles for fusing ncRNAs to RNA aptamers to engineer allosteric RNA fusion molecules that modulate the activity of ncRNAs in a ligand-inducible way in Escherichia coli. We apply these principles to ncRNA regulators that can regulate translation (IS10 ncRNA) and transcription (pT181 ncRNA), and demonstrate that our design strategy exhibits high modularity between the aptamer ligand-sensing motif and the ncRNA target-recognition motif, which allows us to reconfigure these two motifs to engineer orthogonally acting fusion molecules that respond to different ligands and regulate different targets in the same cell. Finally, we show that the same ncRNA fused with different sensing domains results in a sensory-level NOR gate that integrates multiple input signals to perform genetic logic. These ligand-sensing ncRNA regulators provide useful tools to modulate the activity of structurally related families of ncRNAs, and building upon the growing body of RNA synthetic biology, our ability to design aptamer–ncRNA fusion molecules offers new ways to engineer ligand-sensing regulatory circuits.},

Eukaryotic cells execute complex transcriptional programs in which specific loci throughout the genome are regulated in distinct ways by targeted regulatory assemblies. We have applied this principle to generate synthetic CRISPR-based transcriptional programs in yeast and human cells. By extending guide RNAs to include effector protein recruitment sites, we construct modular scaffold RNAs that encode both target locus and regulatory action. Sets of scaffold RNAs can be used to generate synthetic multigene transcriptional programs in which some genes are activated and others are repressed. We apply this approach to flexibly redirect flux through a complex branched metabolic pathway in yeast. Moreover, these programs can be executed by inducing expression of the dCas9 protein, which acts as a single master regulatory control point. CRISPR-associated RNA scaffolds provide a powerful way to construct synthetic gene expression programs for a wide range of applications, including rewiring cell fates or engineering metabolic pathways.},

There is a great deal of flexibility in the design of such a sensor and factors such as the molecule to be detected and the downstream experiments in which the sensor will be applied should guide the specific blueprint of the final construct.

In Bacillus subtilis, this mRNA motif is located on at least five separate transcriptional units that together encode 17 genes that are mostly involved in purine transport and purine nucleotide biosynthesis. Our findings provide further examples of mRNAs that sense metabolites and that control gene expression without the need for protein factors.

	volume = {136},
	abstract = {Hydrogen bonds are ubiquitous in enzyme active sites, providing binding interactions and stabilizing charge rearrangements on substrate groups over the course of a reaction. But understanding the origin and magnitude of their catalytic contributions relative to hydrogen bonds made in aqueous solution remains difficult, in part because of complexities encountered in energetic interpretation of traditional site-directed mutagenesis experiments. It has been proposed for ketosteroid isomerase and other enzymes that active site hydrogen bonding groups provide energetic stabilization via “short, strong” or “low-barrier” hydrogen bonds that are formed due to matching of their pKa or proton affinity to that of the transition state. It has also been proposed that the ketosteroid isomerase and other enzyme active sites provide electrostatic environments that result in larger energetic responses (i.e., greater “sensitivity”) to ground-state to transition-state charge rearrangement, relative to aqueous solution, thereby providing catalysis relative to the corresponding reaction in water. To test these models, we substituted tyrosine with fluorotyrosines (F-Tyr’s) in the ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) oxyanion hole to systematically vary the proton affinity of an active site hydrogen bond donor while minimizing steric or structural effects. We found that a 40-fold increase in intrinsic F-Tyr acidity caused no significant change in activity for reactions with three different substrates. F-Tyr substitution did not change the solvent or primary kinetic isotope effect for proton abstraction, consistent with no change in mechanism arising from these substitutions. The observed shallow dependence of activity on the pKa of the substituted Tyr residues suggests that the KSI oxyanion hole does not provide catalysis by forming an energetically exceptional pKa-matched hydrogen bond. In addition, the shallow dependence provides no indication of an active site electrostatic environment that greatly enhances the energetic response to charge accumulation, consistent with prior experimental results.},

Riboswitches consist of an aptamer that recognizes the ligand and an expression platform that couples ligand binding to a change in gene expression. Using in vitro selection, it is possible to screen large (∼1013 members) libraries of RNA sequences to discover new aptamers. However, limitations in bacterial transformation efficiency make screening such large libraries for riboswitch function in intact cells impractical. Here we show that synthetic riboswitches function in an E. coli S30 extract in a manner similar to how they function in intact E. coli cells. We discovered that, although this family of riboswitches regulates the initiation of protein translation, the fate of whether an RNA message is translated is determined during transcription. Thus, ligand binding does not bias a population of rapidly equilibrating RNA structures, but rather, co-transcriptional ligand binding kinetically traps the RNA in a conformation that supports efficient translation. In addition to providing new insights into the mechanisms of action of a family of synthetic riboswitches, our experiments suggest that it may be possible to perform selections for novel synthetic riboswitches in an in vitro system.},

	abstract = {Entropic effects have often been invoked to explain the extraordinary catalytic power of enzymes. In particular, the hypothesis that enzymes can use part of the substrate-binding free energy to reduce the entropic penalty associated with the subsequent chemical transformation has been very influential. The enzymatic reaction of cytidine deaminase appears to be a distinct example. Here, substrate binding is associated with a significant entropy loss that closely matches the activation entropy penalty for the uncatalyzed reaction in water, whereas the activation entropy for the rate-limiting catalytic step in the enzyme is close to zero. Herein, we report extensive computer simulations of the cytidine deaminase reaction and its temperature dependence. The energetics of the catalytic reaction is first evaluated by density functional theory calculations. These results are then used to parametrize an empirical valence bond description of the reaction, which allows efficient sampling by molecular dynamics simulations and computation of Arrhenius plots. The thermodynamic activation parameters calculated by this approach are in excellent agreement with experimental data and indeed show an activation entropy close to zero for the rate-limiting transition state. However, the origin of this effect is a change of reaction mechanism compared the uncatalyzed reaction. The enzyme operates by hydroxide ion attack, which is intrinsically associated with a favorable activation entropy. Hence, this has little to do with utilization of binding free energy to pay the entropic penalty but rather reflects how a preorganized active site can stabilize a reaction path that is not operational in solution.},

We report the development of a statistical thermodynamic model that predicts the sequence-structure-function relationship for translation-regulating riboswitches that activate gene expression, characterized inside cells and within cell-free transcription–translation assays. Using the model, we carried out automated computational design of 62 synthetic riboswitches that used six different RNA aptamers to sense diverse chemicals (theophylline, tetramethylrosamine, fluoride, dopamine, thyroxine, 2,4-dinitrotoluene) and activated gene expression by up to 383-fold. The model explains how aptamer structure, ligand affinity, switching free energy and macromolecular crowding collectively control riboswitch activation. Our model-based approach for engineering riboswitches quantitatively confirms several physical mechanisms governing ligand-induced RNA shape-change and enables the development of cell-free and bacterial sensors for diverse applications.},

	abstract = {A bio-based economy has the potential to provide sustainable substitutes for petroleum-based products and new chemical building blocks for advanced materials. We previously engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae for industrial production of the isoprenoid artemisinic acid for use in antimalarial treatments. Adapting these strains for biosynthesis of other isoprenoids such as β-farnesene (C15H24), a plant sesquiterpene with versatile industrial applications, is straightforward. However, S. cerevisiae uses a chemically inefficient pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis, resulting in yield and productivity limitations incompatible with commodity-scale production. Here we use four non-native metabolic reactions to rewire central carbon metabolism in S. cerevisiae, enabling biosynthesis of cytosolic acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA, the two-carbon isoprenoid precursor) with a reduced ATP requirement, reduced loss of carbon to CO2-emitting reactions, and improved pathway redox balance. We show that strains with rewired central metabolism can devote an identical quantity of sugar to farnesene production as control strains, yet produce 25\% more farnesene with that sugar while requiring 75\% less oxygen. These changes lower feedstock costs and dramatically increase productivity in industrial fermentations which are by necessity oxygen-constrained. Despite altering key regulatory nodes, engineered strains grow robustly under taxing industrial conditions, maintaining stable yield for two weeks in broth that reaches {\textgreater}15\% farnesene by volume. This illustrates that rewiring yeast central metabolism is a viable strategy for cost-effective, large-scale production of acetyl-CoA-derived molecules.},

Although there are many demonstrated successes from using knowledge-based potential energies, computing entropies of proteins has lagged far behind. Here we take an entirely different approach and evaluate knowledge-based conformational entropies of proteins based on the observed frequencies of contact changes between amino acids in a set of 167 diverse proteins, each of which has two alternative structures. The results show that charged and polar interactions break more often than hydrophobic pairs. This pattern correlates strongly with the average solvent exposure of amino acids in globular proteins, as well as with polarity indices and the sizes of the amino acids. Knowledge-based entropies are derived by using the inverse Boltzmann relationship, in a manner analogous to the way that knowledge-based potentials have been extracted. Including these new knowledge-based entropies almost doubles the performance of knowledge-based potentials in selecting the native protein structures from decoy sets. Beyond the overall energy–entropy compensation, a similar compensation is seen for individual pairs of interacting amino acids. The entropies in this report have immediate applications for 3D structure prediction, protein model assessment, and protein engineering and design.},

	abstract = {Summary Synthetic riboswitches constructed from RNA aptamers provide a means to control bacterial gene expression using exogenous ligands. A common theme among riboswitches that function at the translational level is that the RNA aptamer interacts with the ribosome-binding site (RBS) of a gene via an intervening sequence known as an expression platform. Structural rearrangements of the expression platform convert ligand binding into a change in gene expression. While methods for selecting RNA aptamers that bind ligands are well established, few general methods have been reported for converting these aptamers into synthetic riboswitches with desirable properties. We have developed two such methods that not only provide the throughput of genetic selections, but also feature the quantitative nature of genetic screens. One method, based on cell motility, is operationally simple and requires only standard consumables; while the other, based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), is particularly adept at identifying synthetic riboswitches that are highly dynamic and display very low levels of background expression in the absence of the ligand. Here we present detailed procedures for screening libraries for riboswitches using the two methods.},

Wives demonstrated greater and more persistent physiological changes related to marital conflict than husbands. To assess the generalizability of these physiological changes, a similar laboratory paradigm was used with 31 older couples (mean age = 67) who had been married an average of 42 years.

We demonstrate that functional RNA domains up to at least 4.8 kb long can be inserted in CRISPR guide RNA at multiple points, allowing the construction of Cas9 complexes with protein-binding cassettes, artificial aptamers, pools of random sequences and natural long noncoding RNAs. A unique feature of CRISP-Disp is the multiplexing of distinct functions at multiple targets, limited only by the availability of functional RNA motifs. We anticipate the use of CRISP-Disp for ectopically targeting functional RNAs and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes to genomic loci.},

	abstract = {Riboswitches are cis-acting genetic regulatory elements found commonly in bacterial mRNAs that consist of a metabolite-responsive aptamer domain coupled to a regulatory switch. Purine riboswitches respond to intracellular concentrations of either adenine or guanine/hypoxanthine to control gene expression. The aptamer domain of the purine riboswitch contains a pyrimidine residue (Y74) that forms a Watson–Crick base-pairing interaction with the bound purine nucleobase ligand that discriminates between adenine and guanine. We sought to understand the structural basis of this specificity and the mechanism of ligand recognition by the purine riboswitch. Here, we present the 2,6-diaminopurine-bound structure of a C74U mutant of the xpt-pbuX guanine riboswitch, along with a detailed thermodynamic and kinetic analysis of nucleobase recognition by both the native and mutant riboswitches. These studies demonstrate clearly that the pyrimidine at position 74 is the sole determinant of purine riboswitch specificity. In addition, the mutant riboswitch binds adenine and adenine derivatives well compared with the guanine-responsive riboswitch. Under our experimental conditions, 2,6-diaminopurine binds the RNA with ΔH=−40.3 kcal mol−1, ΔS=−97.6 cal mol−1 K−1, and ΔG=−10.73 kcal mol−1. A kinetic determination of the slow rate (0.15×105 M−1 s−1 and 2.1×105 mM−1 s−1 for 2-aminopurine binding the adenine-responsive mutant riboswitch and 7-deazaguanine-binding guanine riboswitch, respectively) of association under varying experimental conditions allowed us to propose a mechanism for ligand recognition by the purine riboswitch. A conformationally dynamic unliganded state for the binding pocket is stabilized first by the Watson–Crick base pairing between the ligand and Y74, and by the subsequent ordering of the J2/3 loop, enclosing the ligand within the three-way junction.},

The bacterial immune protein Cas9 is a component of one of these CRISPR/Cas systems and has recently been adapted as a tool for genome editing. Cas9 is easily targeted to bind and cleave a DNA sequence via a complementary RNA; this straightforward programmability has gained Cas9 rapid acceptance in the field of genetic engineering. While this technology has developed quickly, a number of challenges regarding Cas9 specificity, efficiency, fusion protein function, and spatiotemporal control within the cell remain. In this work, we develop a platform for constructing novel proteins to address these open questions. We demonstrate methods to either screen or select active Cas9 mutants and use the screening technique to isolate functional Cas9 variants with a heterologous PDZ domain inserted within the protein. As a proof of concept, these methods lay the groundwork for the future construction of diverse Cas9 proteins. Straightforward and accessible techniques for genetic editing are helping to elucidate biology in new and exciting ways; a platform to engineer new functionalities into Cas9 will help forge the next generation of genome-modifying tools.},

We developed a procedure to systematically analyze known riboswitch classes to find additional variants that have altered their ligand specificity. This approach uses multiple-sequence alignments, atomic-resolution structural information, and riboswitch gene associations. Among the discoveries are unique variants of the guanine riboswitch class that most tightly bind the nucleoside 2′-deoxyguanosine. In addition, we identified variants of the glycine riboswitch class that no longer recognize this amino acid, additional members of a rare flavin mononucleotide (FMN) variant class, and also variants of c-di-GMP-I and -II riboswitches that might recognize different bacterial signaling molecules. These findings further reveal the diverse molecular sensing capabilities of RNA, which highlights the potential for discovering a large number of additional natural riboswitch classes.},

	abstract = {Systems for conditional gene expression are powerful tools in basic research as well as in biotechnology. For future applications, it is of great importance to engineer orthogonal genetic switches that function reliably in diverse contexts. RNA-based switches have the advantage that effector molecules interact immediately with regulatory modules inserted into the target RNAs, getting rid of the need of transcription factors usually mediating genetic control. Artificial riboswitches are characterized by their simplicity and small size accompanied by a high degree of modularity. We have recently reported a series of hammerhead ribozyme-based artificial riboswitches that allow for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression via switching mRNA, tRNA, or rRNA functions. A more widespread application was so far hampered by moderate switching performances and a limited set of effector molecules available. Here, we report the re-engineering of hammerhead ribozymes in order to respond efficiently to aminoglycoside antibiotics. We first established an in vivo selection protocol in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that enabled us to search large sequence spaces for optimized switches. We then envisioned and characterized a novel strategy of attaching the aptamer to the ribozyme catalytic core, increasing the design options for rendering the ribozyme ligand-dependent. These innovations enabled the development of neomycin-dependent RNA modules that switch gene expression up to 25-fold. The presented aminoglycoside-responsive riboswitches belong to the best-performing RNA-based genetic regulators reported so far. The developed in vivo selection protocol should allow for sampling of large sequence spaces for engineering of further optimized riboswitches.},

Type I accounts for 95\% of CRISPR systems, and has been used to control gene expression and cell fate. During CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided interference, Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defence) facilitates the crRNA-guided invasion of double-stranded DNA for complementary base-pairing with the target DNA strand while displacing the non-target strand, forming an R-loop. Cas3, which has nuclease and helicase activities, is subsequently recruited to degrade two DNA strands. A protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence flanking target DNA is crucial for self versus foreign discrimination. Here we present the 2.45 Å crystal structure of Escherichia coli Cascade bound to a foreign double-stranded DNA target. The 5′-ATG PAM is recognized in duplex form, from the minor groove side, by three structural features in the Cascade Cse1 subunit. The promiscuity inherent to minor groove DNA recognition rationalizes the observation that a single Cascade complex can respond to several distinct PAM sequences. Optimal PAM recognition coincides with wedge insertion, initiating directional target DNA strand unwinding to allow segmented base-pairing with crRNA. The non-target strand is guided along a parallel path 25 Å apart, and the R-loop structure is further stabilized by locking this strand behind the Cse2 dimer. These observations provide the structural basis for understanding the PAM-dependent directional R-loop formation process.},

Using a combination of chemical genetics and genetic selection, we have developed riboswitches that are selective for synthetic “nonnatural” small molecules and no longer respond to the natural intracellular ligands. The orthogonal selectivity of the riboswitches is also demonstrated in vitro using isothermal titration calorimetry and x-ray crystallography. The riboswitches allow highly responsive, dose-dependent, orthogonally selective, and dynamic control of gene expression in vivo. It is possible that this approach may be further developed to reengineer other natural riboswitches for application as small-molecule responsive genetic switches in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.},

These features allowed us to construct a very efficient artificial riboswitch in bacteria. Following the design of naturally occurring three-way junctions we attached an additional helix (IV) to stem I of the HHR while maintaining very fast cleavage rates. We found that the cleavage activity strongly depends on the exact design of the junction site. Incorporation of the novel ribozyme scaffold into a bacterial mRNA allowed the control of gene expression mediated by autocatalytic cleavage of the ribozyme. Appending an aptamer to the newly introduced stem enabled the identification of very powerful theophylline-inducible RNA switches by in vivo screening. Further investigations revealed a cascading system operating beyond the ribozyme-dependent mechanism.

A brief perspective of the present use of chlorine in high‐ratio cake flours is included. Investigations of the uptake of gaseous chlorine by flour and its distribution among and chemical action upon the major flour components (water, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate) are assessed. The physical effects of chlorination as demonstrated by experiments with batters and cakes and by physicochemical observations of flour and its fractions are also considered. The characteristics of the starch in flour appear to be critical in high‐ratio cakes. Chlorine treatment modifies the gelatinization behavior of the starch granules yet does not change their gelatinization temperature nor is there evidence of chemical attack upon the starch molecules. Therefore, it is suggested that chlorine effects the necessary changes in starch behavior by reacting with the noncarbohydrate surface contaminants on the granules. Alternative methods of improving high‐ratio cake flours are mentioned, particularly heat‐treatment processes.},

An important proof of principle for that system was provided by demonstrating the ability of one specific small molecule inhibitor of RNA self-cleavage, toyocamycin, to control gene expression in vitro and vivo. Here, we describe the development of the high-throughput screening (HTS) assay that led to the identification of toyocamycin and other molecules capable of inhibiting RNA self-cleavage in mammalian cells. To identify small molecules that can serve as inhibitors of ribozyme self-cleavage, we established a cell-based assay in which expression of a luciferase (luc) reporter is controlled by ribozyme sequences, and screened 58,076 compounds for their ability to induce luciferase expression. Fifteen compounds able to inhibit ribozyme self-cleavage in cells were identified through this screen. The most potent of the inhibitors identified were toyocamycin and 5-fluorouridine (FUR), nucleoside analogs carrying modifications of the 7-position and 5-position of the purine or pyrimidine bases. Individually, these two compounds were able to induce gene expression of the ribozyme-controlled reporter ∼365-fold and 110-fold, respectively. Studies of the mechanism of action of the ribozyme inhibitors indicate that the compounds must be incorporated into RNA in order to inhibit RNA self-cleavage.},

The spatiotemporal organization and dynamics of chromatin play critical roles in regulating genome function. However, visualizing specific, endogenous genomic loci remains challenging in living cells. Here, we demonstrate such an imaging technique by repurposing the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system. Using an EGFP-tagged endonuclease-deficient Cas9 protein and a structurally optimized small guide (sg) RNA, we show robust imaging of repetitive elements in telomeres and coding genes in living cells. Furthermore, an array of sgRNAs tiling along the target locus enables the visualization of nonrepetitive genomic sequences. Using this method, we have studied telomere dynamics during elongation or disruption, the subnuclear localization of the MUC4 loci, the cohesion of replicated MUC4 loci on sister chromatids, and their dynamic behaviors during mitosis. This CRISPR imaging tool has potential to significantly improve the capacity to study the conformation and dynamics of native chromosomes in living human cells.},

	abstract = {Background
Allosteric ribozymes (aptazymes) that have extraordinary activation parameters have been generated in vitro by design and selection. For example, hammerhead and ligase ribozymes that are activated by small organic effectors and protein effectors have been selected from random sequence pools appended to extant ribozymes. Many ribozymes, especially self-splicing introns, are known control gene regulation or viral replication in vivo. We attempted to generate Group I self-splicing introns that were activated by a small organic effector, theophylline, and to show that such Group I aptazymes could mediate theophylline-dependent splicing in vivo.

Results
By appending aptamers to the Group I self-splicing intron, we have generated a Group I aptazyme whose in vivo splicing is controlled by exogenously added small molecules. Substantial differences in gene regulation could be observed with compounds that differed by as little as a single methyl group. The effector-specificity of the Group I aptazyme could be rationally engineered for new effector molecules.

Conclusion
Group I aptazymes may find applications as genetic regulatory switches for generating conditional knockouts at the level of mRNA or for developing economically viable gene therapies.},

	abstract = {We present a conditional gene expression system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae which exploits direct RNA–metabolite interactions as a mechanism of genetic control. We inserted preselected tetracycline (tc) binding aptamers into the 5′-UTR of a GFP encoding mRNA. While aptamer insertion generally reduces GFP expression, one group of aptamers displayed an additional, up to 6-fold, decrease in fluorescence upon tc addition. Regulation is observed for aptamers inserted cap-proximal or near the start codon, but is more pronounced from the latter position. Increasing the thermodynamic stability of the aptamer augments regulation but reduces expression of GFP. Decreasing the stability leads to the opposite effect. We defined nucleotides which influence the regulatory properties of the aptamer. Exchanging a nucleotide probably involved in tc binding only influences regulation, while mutations at another position alter expression in the absence of tc, without affecting regulation. Thus, we have developed and characterized a regulatory system which is easy to establish and controlled by a non-toxic, small ligand with good cell permeability.},

Here, we report the 1.7 Å resolution crystal structures of Cas9 from Francisella novicida (FnCas9), one of the largest Cas9 orthologs, in complex with a guide RNA and its PAM-containing DNA targets. A structural comparison of FnCas9 with other Cas9 orthologs revealed striking conserved and divergent features among distantly related CRISPR-Cas9 systems. We found that FnCas9 recognizes the 5′-NGG-3′ PAM, and used the structural information to create a variant that can recognize the more relaxed 5′-YG-3′ PAM. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the FnCas9-ribonucleoprotein complex can be microinjected into mouse zygotes to edit endogenous sites with the 5′-YG-3′ PAM, thus expanding the target space of the CRISPR-Cas9 toolbox.},

For example, RNA has sufficient structural plasticity to form ribozyme and receptor elements that exhibit considerable enzymatic power and binding specificity. Moreover, these activities can be combined to create allosteric ribozymes that are modulated by effector molecules. It has also been proposed that certain messenger RNAs might use allosteric mechanisms to mediate regulatory responses depending on specific metabolites. We report here that mRNAs encoding enzymes involved in thiamine (vitamin B1) biosynthesis in Escherichia coli can bind thiamine or its pyrophosphate derivative without the need for protein cofactors. The mRNA–effector complex adopts a distinct structure that sequesters the ribosome-binding site and leads to a reduction in gene expression. This metabolite-sensing regulatory system provides an example of a ‘riboswitch’ whose evolutionary origin might pre-date the emergence of proteins.},

Here, we report the reengineering of a laboratory strain of Escherichia coli with a tunable type 3 secretion system that can efficiently deliver heterologous proteins into mammalian cells, thereby circumventing the need for virulence attenuation. We first introduced a 31 kB region of Shigella flexneri DNA that encodes all of the information needed to form the secretion nanomachine onto a plasmid that can be directly propagated within E. coli or integrated into the E. coli chromosome. To provide flexible control over type 3 secretion and protein delivery, we generated plasmids expressing master regulators of the type 3 system from either constitutive or inducible promoters. We then constructed a Gateway-compatible plasmid library of type 3 secretion sequences to enable rapid screening and identification of sequences that do not perturb function when fused to heterologous protein substrates and optimized their delivery into mammalian cells. Combining these elements, we found that coordinated expression of the type 3 secretion system and modified target protein substrates produces a nonpathogenic strain that expresses, secretes, and delivers heterologous proteins into mammalian cells. This reengineered system thus provides a highly flexible protein delivery platform with potential for future therapeutic applications.},

The interface residues were replaced with alanine to generate the interface mutants R72A, E118A, N120A and E118A/N120A.

The crystal structure of R72A determined at 2.5 Å resolution and the fluorescence spectra of all the mutants indicated that the interface mutations altered the active-site geometry and resulted in the decreases of the conformational stability as well as the catalytic activity of KSI.

The splicing reaction proceeds efficiently only when the designed RNA associates with the designed protein either in vivo or in vitro. In vivo mutagenic protein selection was effective for improving the capability of the protein. Kinetic analyses indicate that the protein promotes RNA folding to establish an active conformation. The fact that the conversion of a ribozyme to an RNP can be accomplished by simple molecular design supports the RNA world hypothesis and suggests that a natural active RNP might have evolved readily from a ribozyme.},

Using a combination of directed evolution and site-directed mutagenesis, we dissected the functional elements of the evolved transcriptional activators.

Nuclease-dead CRISPR–dCas9 transcriptional regulators, while offering an approach for controlling individual gene expression, remain incapable of dynamically coordinating complex transcriptional events. Here, we describe a flexible dCas9-based platform for chemical-inducible complex gene regulation. From a screen of chemical- and light-inducible dimerization systems, we identified two potent chemical inducers that mediate efficient gene activation and repression in mammalian cells. We combined these inducers with orthogonal dCas9 regulators to independently control expression of different genes within the same cell. Using this platform, we further devised AND, OR, NAND, and NOR dCas9 logic operators and a diametric regulator that activates gene expression with one inducer and represses with another. This work provides a robust CRISPR–dCas9-based platform for enacting complex transcription programs that is suitable for large-scale transcriptome engineering.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis delta virus ribozyme folds into a tightly packed tertiary structure. However, unlike other ribozymes, it does not appear to be able to follow alternative folding pathways. Molecular engineering of the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme led to the development of a ribozyme possessing an endoribonuclease activity that is under the control of a G-quadruplex structure (i.e., a G-quartzyme). This latter species represents an entirely new class of ribozyme. Mutants of this ribozyme were then generated in order to shed light on the modulation of the cleavage activity caused by the presence of the G-quadruplex structure. Kinetic characterization of the G-quartzyme was performed under various single turnover conditions. It was found to be active only in the presence of potassium cations that act as counter ions in the positioning of the four coplanar guanines that form the building block of the G-quadruplex structure. The G-quartzyme behaves as an allosteric ribozyme, with the potassium cations acting as positive effectors with a Hill coefficient of 2.9 ± 0.2. The conformation transition caused by the presence of the potassium ions is supported by enzymatic and chemical probing of both the inactive (off) and active (on) structures. This study shows that it is possible to interfere with the tight structure of the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme by adding an unusual, stable structure. To our knowledge, the G-quartzyme is the sole ribozyme that exhibits a monovalent cation-dependent activity.},

Here, we describe a novel strategy for post-transcriptional gene regulation in mammalian cells in which RNAi is specifically modulated through RNA aptamer–small molecule interaction. Incorporation of an RNA aptamer for theophylline in the loop region of a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) designed to silence fluorescent reporter genes led to dose-dependent inhibition of RNAi by theophylline. shRNA cleavage experiments using recombinant Dicer demonstrated that theophylline inhibited cleavage of an aptamer-fused shRNA by Dicer in vitro. Inhibition of siRNA production by theophylline was also observed in vivo. The results presented here provide the first evidence of specific RNA–small molecule interaction affecting RNAi, and a novel strategy to regulate mammalian gene expression by small molecules without engineered proteins.},

The design of such variants was possible even though the tertiary folding of the two DNAzymes is not known. Variants of the hammerhead ribozyme were constructed, to respond to the effectors ATP and flavin mononucleotide. Whereas in conventional allosteric ribozymes, effector-binding modulates the chemical step of catalysis, here, effectors exercise their effect upon the substrate-binding step, by stabilizing the enzyme–substrate complex. Because such an approach for controlling the activity of DNAzymes/ribozymes requires no prior knowledge of the enzyme's secondary or tertiary folding, this regulatory strategy should be generally applicable to any RNA-cleaving ribozyme or DNAzyme, natural or in vitro selected, provided substrate-recognition is achieved by Watson–Crick base-pairing.},

Additionally, we mutate the target of the cancer therapeutic bortezomib, PSMB5, and identify known and novel mutations that confer bortezomib resistance. Finally, using a hyperactive AID variant, we mutagenize loci both upstream and downstream of transcriptional start sites.

Feedback control based on relevant molecules, including toxic intermediates and environmental signals, would enable genetic circuits to react appropriately to changing conditions. In this work, variants of qacR, a tetR family repressor, were generated by computational protein design and screened in a cell-free transcription?translation (TX-TL) system for responsiveness to a new targeted effector. The modified repressors target vanillin, a growth-inhibiting small molecule found in lignocellulosic hydrolysates and other industrial processes. Promising candidates from the in vitro screen were further characterized in vitro and in vivo in a gene circuit. The screen yielded two qacR mutants that respond to vanillin both in vitro and in vivo. While the mutants exhibit some toxicity to cells, presumably due to off-target effects, they are prime starting points for directed evolution toward vanillin sensors with the specifications required for use in a dynamic control loop. We believe this process, a combination of the generation of variants coupled with in vitro screening, can serve as a framework for designing new sensors for other target compounds.},

Indeed, certain RNA and DNA oligonucleotides have previously been shown to bind duplex DNA and repress in vitro transcription by occluding the binding of transcription factors or RNA polymerase at target genes. While similar oligonucleotides have reportedly caused repression of target genes in cultured cells, physical evidence of triple helix formation in vivo is generally lacking. In the present study we wished to determine whether RNA transcripts could repress the activity of an Escherichia coli promoter in vivo by binding to the duplex promoter DNA. An in vivo genetic selection previously developed to identify DNA binding proteins was modified for this purpose. Using expression libraries encoding RNAs predisposed to forming triple helices with a DNA target site, we have selected RNA transcripts that confer survival to E.coli by disrupting transcriptional interference. Surprisingly, genetic and biochemical evidence shows that these RNAs do not form triple helices at the target promoter in vivo, despite the fact that they contain sequences capable of forming triple helices at the duplex DNA target in vitro. Rather, the selected RNAs appear to disrupt transcriptional interference via an antisense mechanism.},

Living systems clearly operate out of thermodynamic equilibrium at the molecular scale. How these activities are manifest at the cellular scale, however, has been unclear. Battle et al. use video microscopy together with statistical thermodynamics to unambiguously identify which random fluctuations at the cellular scale are out of equilibrium (see the Perspective by Rupprecht and Prost). Transitions between states obey a detailed balance in equilibrium, whereas imbalanced transitions point to nonequilibrium dynamics. For instance, nonequilibrium dynamics can be identified in the periodic beating of a flagellum and in the nonperiodic fluctuations of primary cilia.
Science, this issue p. 604; see also p. 514
Systems in thermodynamic equilibrium are not only characterized by time-independent macroscopic properties, but also satisfy the principle of detailed balance in the transitions between microscopic configurations. Living systems function out of equilibrium and are characterized by directed fluxes through chemical states, which violate detailed balance at the molecular scale. Here we introduce a method to probe for broken detailed balance and demonstrate how such nonequilibrium dynamics are manifest at the mesosopic scale. The periodic beating of an isolated flagellum from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii exhibits probability flux in the phase space of shapes. With a model, we show how the breaking of detailed balance can also be quantified in stationary, nonequilibrium stochastic systems in the absence of periodic motion. We further demonstrate such broken detailed balance in the nonperiodic fluctuations of primary cilia of epithelial cells. Our analysis provides a general tool to identify nonequilibrium dynamics in cells and tissues.
Nonequilibrium dynamics can be identified in randomly fluctuating mesoscopic systems.

Moreover, modifications of the peripheral loops 1 and 2 of one of these natural hammerheads induced a {\textgreater}100-fold reduction of the self-cleavage constant, whereas engineering a trans-acting artificial hammerhead into a cis derivative by introducing a loop 1 had no effect. These data show that regions external to the central conserved core of natural hammerheads play a role in catalysis, and suggest the existence of tertiary interactions between these peripheral regions. The interactions, determined by the sequence and size of loops 1 and 2 and most likely of helices I and II, must result from natural selection and should be studied in order to better understand the hammerhead requirements in vivo.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that effective protein production requires coordination of multiple cotranslational cellular processes, which are heavily affected by translation timing. Until recently, protein engineering has focused on codon optimization to maximize protein production rates, mostly considering the effect of tRNA abundance. However, as it relates to complex multidomain proteins, it has been hypothesized that strategic translational pauses between domains and between distinct individual structural motifs can prevent interactions between nascent chain fragments that generate kinetically trapped misfolded peptides and thereby enhance protein yields. In this study, we introduce synthetic transient pauses between structural domains in a heterologous model protein based on designed patterns of affinity between the mRNA and the anti-Shine?Dalgarno (aSD) sequence on the ribosome. We demonstrate that optimizing translation attenuation at domain boundaries can predictably affect solubility patterns in bacteria. Exploration of the affinity space showed that modifying less than 1\% of the nucleotides (on a small 12 amino acid linker) can vary soluble protein yields up to ?7-fold without altering the primary sequence of the protein. In the context of longer linkers, where a larger number of distinct structural motifs can fold outside the ribosome, optimal synonymous codon variations resulted in an additional 2.1-fold increase in solubility, relative to that of nonoptimized linkers of the same length. While rational construction of 54 linkers of various affinities showed a significant correlation between protein solubility and predicted affinity, only weaker correlations were observed between tRNA abundance and protein solubility. We also demonstrate that naturally occurring high-affinity clusters are present between structural domains of ?-galactosidase, one of Escherichia coli?s largest native proteins. Interdomain ribosomal affinity is an important factor that has not previously been explored in the context of protein engineering.},

In addition to engineering genetic switches, the interconnection of individual switches becomes increasingly important for the construction of more complex genetic networks. In particular, RNA-based switches of gene expression have become a powerful tool to post-transcriptionally program genetic circuits. RNAs used for regulatory purposes have the advantage to transmit, sense, process and execute information. We have recently used the hammerhead ribozyme to control translation initiation in a small molecule-dependent fashion. In addition, riboregulators have been constructed in which a small RNA acts as transmitter molecule to control translation of a target mRNA. In this study, we combine both concepts and redesign the hammerhead ribozyme to sense small trans-acting RNAs (taRNAs) as input molecules resulting in repression of translation initiation in Escherichia coli. Importantly, our ribozyme-based expression platform is compatible with previously reported artificial taRNAs, which were reported to act as inducers of gene expression. In addition, we provide several insights into key requirements of riboregulatory systems, including the influences of varying transcriptional induction of the taRNA and mRNA transcripts, 5′-processing of taRNAs, as well as altering the secondary structure of the taRNA. In conclusion, we introduce an RNA-responsive ribozyme-based expression system to the field of artificial riboregulators that can serve as reprogrammable platform for engineering higher-order genetic circuits.},

Efforts to construct synthetic networks in living cells have been hindered by the limited number of regulatory components that provide wide dynamic range and low crosstalk. Here, we report a class of de-novo-designed prokaryotic riboregulators called toehold switches that activate gene expression in response to cognate RNAs with arbitrary sequences. Toehold switches provide a high level of orthogonality and can be forward engineered to provide average dynamic range above 400. We show that switches can be integrated into the genome to regulate endogenous genes and use them as sensors that respond to endogenous RNAs. We exploit the orthogonality of toehold switches to regulate 12 genes independently and to construct a genetic circuit that evaluates 4-input AND logic. Toehold switches, with their wide dynamic range, orthogonality, and programmability, represent a versatile and powerful platform for regulation of translation, offering diverse applications in molecular biology, synthetic biology, and biotechnology.},

The creation of new synthetic riboswitches from in vitro selected aptamers benefits from rapid, high-throughput methods for identifying switches capable of triggering dramatic changes in gene expression in the presence of a desired ligand. Here we present a flow cytometry-based screen for identifying synthetic riboswitches that induce robust increases in gene expression in the presence of theophylline. The performance characteristics of our newly identified riboswitches exceed those of previously described natural and synthetic riboswitches. Sequencing data and structure probing experiments reveal the ribosome binding site to be an important determinant of how well a switch performs and may provide insights into the design of new synthetic riboswitches.},

To create an artificial genetic switch that acts at the level of transcription, we fused a small molecule binding aptamer to a previously evolved RNA that activates transcription when localized to a promoter. We designed a conformational shift in which a helical element required for transcriptional activation was stabilized upon ligand binding. Selection and screening in S. cerevisiae optimized the linker region, generating an RNA that is 10-fold more active in the presence of tetramethylrosamine (TMR). TMR increases the activity of this evolved RNA in a graded, dose-dependent manner. Our results exemplify a strategy for controlling the activity of laboratory-evolved RNAs in living cells.},

	abstract = {Background: Antibiotics can interfere with RNA activity. Translation of RNA by the prokaryotic ribosome, self-splicing of group I introns, HIV replication and hammerhead ribozyme cleavage are inhibited by the aminoglycoside neomycin B. To explore the molecular basis by which small molecules such as antibiotics inhibit RNA function, we undertook an in vitro selection to obtain a variety of RNA molecules with the capacity to recognize neomycin. Results: The majority of the RNA molecules selected to specifically bind neomycin share a region of nucleotide sequence homology. From chemical probing and covariations among different clones we show that in all sequences this region folds into a hairpin structure, which from footprinting and partial alkaline hydrolysis experiments is shown to be the neomycin-binding site. Neomycin is recognized with high affinity (Kd ≈ 100 nM) and high specificity ({\textgreater}100-fold higher affinity for neomycin than for paromomycin). clusions: The fact that RNAs containing the consensus sequence, as well as sequences that display variations within this region, specifically recognize neomycin suggests that a structural motif rather than a particular nucleotide sequence is required for neomycin recognition. We propose that a hairpin stem-loop structural motif, which might feature a widened major groove, may be a prerequisite for neomycin recognition. This structural pattern can be extrapolated to other natural neomycin-responsive RNAs.},

We describe an in vitro selection strategy for the de novo selection of allosteric self-cleaving ribozymes responding to pefloxacin and other quinolone derivatives. Within 16 selection cycles, highly sensitive clones responding to drug levels in the sub-micromolar range were obtained. The morpholine moiety of the quinolone derivatives was required for inhibition of the self-cleavage of the selected ribozymes: modifications of the aromatic system were tolerated better than modifications of the morpholine ring. We also present a theoretical model that analyzes the predicted fraction of ribozymes with a given binding constant and cleavage rate recovered after each selection cycle. This model precisely predicts the actual experimental values obtained with the selection procedure. It can thus be used to determine the optimal conditions for an in vitro selection of an allosteric ribozyme with a desired dissociation constant and cleavage rate for a given application.},

The photochemical core of this process in all photosynthetic organisms is a transmembrane protein called the reaction center. In purple photosynthetic bacteria a simple version of this photoenzyme catalyzes the reduction of a quinone molecule, accompanied by the uptake of two protons from the cytoplasm. This results in the establishment of a proton concentration gradient across the lipid membrane, which can be ultimately harnessed to synthesize ATP. Herein we show that synthetic protocells, based on giant lipid vesicles embedding an oriented population of reaction centers, are capable of generating a photoinduced proton gradient across the membrane. Under continuous illumination, the protocells generate a gradient of 0.061 pH units per min, equivalent to a proton motive force of 3.6 mV⋅min−1. Remarkably, the facile reconstitution of the photosynthetic reaction center in the artificial lipid membrane, obtained by the droplet transfer method, paves the way for the construction of novel and more functional protocells for synthetic biology.},

Mutability and evolution can, however, compromise stability, leading to deterioration of artificial genetic constructs. By eliminating certain sources of instability, these undesired genetic changes can be mitigated. Specifically, deletion of prophages and insertion sequences, nonessential constituents of bacterial genomes, has been shown to be beneficial in cellular and genetic stabilization. Here, we sought to establish a rapid methodology to improve the stability of microbial hosts. The novel workflow involves genome shuffling between a mobile genetic element-free strain and the target cell, and subsequent rounds of CRISPR/Cas-assisted MAGE on multiplex targets. The power and speed of the procedure was demonstrated on E. coli BL21(DE3), a host routinely used for plasmid-based heterologous protein expression. All 9 prophages and 50 insertion elements were efficiently deleted or inactivated. Together with additional targeted manipulations (e.g., inactivation of error-prone DNA-polymerases), the changes resulted in an improved bacterial host with a hybrid (harboring segments of K-12 DNA), 9\%-downsized and clean genome. The combined capacity of phage-mediated generalized transduction and CRISPR/Cas-selected MAGE offers a way for rapid, large scale editing of bacterial genomes.},

Synthetic control of these processes allows dissection of natural systems and the design of new networks. In E. coli, the adaptor SspB tethers ssrA-tagged substrates to the ClpXP protease, causing a modest increase in their rate of degradation. To engineer controlled degradation, we have designed a series of modified ssrA tags that have weakened interactions with ClpXP. When SspB is present, ClpXP degrades purified substrates bearing these engineered peptide tags 100-fold more efficiently. Importantly, substrates bearing these tags are stable in the absence of SspB in vivo but are rapidly degraded upon SspB induction. Our studies supply a conceptual foundation and working components for controllable degradation, improve mechanistic understanding of adaptor-mediated proteolysis, and demonstrate that the relative importance of adaptor proteins in degradation is correlated with the strength of protease-substrate contacts.},

Current protein design methods use protein backbone information from a single protein structure. In order to use alternative protein backbones, the single input protein structure is perturbed in either a random manner or restricted to a predefined set of protein backbone movements. Here, we introduce the FlexiBaL-GP protein design strategy, which incorporates information from multiple protein backbones to guide the search for new alternative high quality protein backbones. These large multi-atom movements of a protein system are learned via the non-linear dimensionality reduction method provided by Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GP-LVM). Using the GP-LVM approach, our strategy jointly searches for new protein backbones and new protein variants. We demonstrate on the ubiquitin–USP21 system that the FlexiBaL-GP design strategy outperforms current protein design approaches.},

To illustrate the utility of the identified sites, we construct an allosterically regulated Cas9 by insertion of the estrogen receptor-α ligand-binding domain. This protein showed robust, ligand-dependent activation in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, establishing a versatile one-component system for inducible and reversible Cas9 activation. Thus, domain insertion profiling facilitates the rapid generation of new Cas9 functionalities and provides useful data for future engineering of Cas9.},

Peptamers that inhibited the pheromone signaling pathway, transcriptional silencing, and the spindle checkpoint were isolated. Putative targets for the inhibitors were identified by a combination of two-hybrid analysis and genetic dissection of the target pathways. This analysis identified Ydr517w as a component of the spindle checkpoint and reinforced earlier indications that Ste50 has both positive and negative roles in pheromone signaling. Analysis of transcript arrays showed that the peptamers were highly specific in their effects, which suggests that they may be useful reagents in organisms that lack sophisticated genetics as well as for identifying components of existing biological pathways that are potential targets for drug discovery.},

	abstract = {RNA hairpins capped by 5′-GNRA-3′ or 5′-UNCG-3′ tetraloops (TLs) are prominent RNA structural motifs. Despite their small size, a wealth of experimental data, and recent progress in theoretical simulations of their structural dynamics and folding, our understanding of the folding and unfolding processes of these small RNA elements is still limited. Theoretical description of the folding and unfolding processes requires robust sampling, which can be achieved by either an exhaustive time scale in standard molecular dynamics simulations or sophisticated enhanced sampling methods, using temperature acceleration or biasing potentials. Here, we study structural dynamics of 5′-GNRA-3′ and 5′-UNCG-3′ TLs by 15-μs-long standard simulations and a series of well-tempered metadynamics, attempting to accelerate sampling by bias in a few chosen collective variables (CVs). Both methods provide useful insights. The unfolding and refolding mechanisms of the GNRA TL observed by well-tempered metadynamics agree with the (reverse) folding mechanism suggested by recent replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. The orientation of the glycosidic bond of the GL4 nucleobase is critical for the UUCG TL folding pathway, and our data strongly support the hypothesis that GL4-anti forms a kinetic trap along the folding pathway. Along with giving useful insight, our study also demonstrates that using only a few CVs apparently does not capture the full folding landscape of the RNA TLs. Despite using several sophisticated selections of the CVs, formation of the loop appears to remain a hidden variable, preventing a full convergence of the metadynamics. Finally, our data suggest that the unfolded state might be overstabilized by the force fields used.},

	abstract = {ConspectusOver the past decade, we have developed a spectroscopic approach to measure electric fields inside matter with high spatial ({\textless}1 Å) and field ({\textless}1 MV/cm) resolution. The approach hinges on exploiting a physical phenomenon known as the vibrational Stark effect (VSE), which ultimately provides a direct mapping between observed vibrational frequencies and electric fields. Therefore, the frequency of a vibrational probe encodes information about the local electric field in the vicinity around the probe. The VSE method has enabled us to understand in great detail the underlying physical nature of several important biomolecular phenomena, such as drug–receptor selectivity in tyrosine kinases, catalysis by the enzyme ketosteroid isomerase, and unidirectional electron transfer in the photosynthetic reaction center. Beyond these specific examples, the VSE has provided a conceptual foundation for how to model intermolecular (noncovalent) interactions in a quantitative, consistent, and general manner.The starting point for research in this area is to choose (or design) a vibrational probe to interrogate the particular system of interest. Vibrational probes are sometimes intrinsic to the system in question, but we have also devised ways to build them into the system (extrinsic probes), often with minimal perturbation. With modern instruments, vibrational frequencies can increasingly be recorded with very high spatial, temporal, and frequency resolution, affording electric field maps correspondingly resolved in space, time, and field magnitude.In this Account, we set out to explain the VSE in broad strokes to make its relevance accessible to chemists of all specialties. Our intention is not to provide an encyclopedic review of published work but rather to motivate the underlying framework of the methodology and to describe how we make and interpret the measurements. Using certain vibrational probes, benchmarked against computer models, it is possible to use the VSE to measure absolute electric fields in arbitrary environments. The VSE approach provides an organizing framework for thinking generally about intermolecular interactions in a quantitative way and may serve as a useful conceptual tool for molecular design.},

	abstract = {This chapter presents the procedure for high-efficiency transformation of yeast by electroporation. The protocol are designed by adapting the principles of bacterial electroporarion to transformarion of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, taking care, in addition, to provide continuous osmotic support of the electrically compromised cells. Preparation of cells in advance of electroporation involves four 5-min centrifugations. There is minimal preincubation with DNA and no carder nucleic acid, and the pulse itself takes only a moment. Subsequent outgrowth is not required, and plating by spreading is sufficient to provide maximal efficiency. A prerequisite for molecular biological manipulation of any organism is a reliable and efficient means for introducing exogenous DNA into the cell. Yet each of the techniques in general use for transforming yeast—namely, lithium acetate transformation and spheroplast transformation, suffers from significant limitations. Lithium acetate transformation, although relatively fast and simple, provides only a low efficiency of DNA transfer (∼l03 colonies/μg of episomal plasmid). Spheroplast transformation, while more efficient (∼1–5 × 104 colonies/μg), is complicated and time consuming.},

We engineered RNA devices that detect signaling through the nuclear factor κB and Wnt signaling pathways in human cells and rewire these pathways to produce new behaviors, thereby linking disease markers to noninvasive sensing and reprogrammed cellular fates.

Although the weak dimerization of Aequorea GFP has not impeded its acceptance as an indispensable tool of cell biology, the obligate tetramerization of DsRed has greatly hindered its use as a genetically encoded fusion tag. We present here the stepwise evolution of DsRed to a dimer and then either to a genetic fusion of two copies of the protein, i.e., a tandem dimer, or to a true monomer designated mRFP1 (monomeric red fluorescent protein). Each subunit interface was disrupted by insertion of arginines, which initially crippled the resulting protein, but red fluorescence could be rescued by random and directed mutagenesis totaling 17 substitutions in the dimer and 33 in mRFP1. Fusions of the gap junction protein connexin43 to mRFP1 formed fully functional junctions, whereas analogous fusions to the tetramer and dimer failed. Although mRFP1 has somewhat lower extinction coefficient, quantum yield, and photostability than DsRed, mRFP1 matures {\textgreater}10 times faster, so that it shows similar brightness in living cells. In addition, the excitation and emission peaks of mRFP1, 584 and 607 nm, are ≈25 nm red-shifted from DsRed, which should confer greater tissue penetration and spectral separation from autofluorescence and other fluorescent proteins.},

We find that the catalytic base residue contributes the most to the electric field stabilization of the transition state of the LDE variants of the KE07 and KE70 enzymes, whereas the electric fields of the remainder of the enzyme and solvent disfavor the catalytic reaction in both cases. By contrast, we show that the electrostatic environment plays a large and stabilizing role for the naturally occurring enzyme ketosteroid isomerase (KSI). These results suggest that LDE is ultimately a limited strategy for improving de novo enzymes since it is largely restricted to optimization of chemical positioning in the active site, thus yielding a ∼3 order magnitude improvement over the uncatalyzed reaction, which we suggest may be an absolute upper bound estimate based on LDE applied to comparable de novo Kemp eliminases and other enzymes like KSI. Instead de novo enzymatic reactions could more productively benefit from optimization of the electrostatics of the protein scaffold in early stages of the computational design, utilizing electric field optimization as guidance.},

The in vivo gene-regulatory activities in the two types of eukaryotic cells correlate with in vitro cleavage activities determined at different physiologically relevant magnesium concentrations. Finally, localization studies with the ligand demonstrate that ribozyme switches respond to ligands present in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm, providing new insight into their mechanism of action. By extending the sensing capabilities of this important class of gene-regulatory device, our work supports the implementation of ribozyme-based devices in applications requiring the detection of protein biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Riboswitches are newly discovered regulatory elements which control a wide set of basic metabolic pathways. They consist solely of RNA, sense their ligand in a preformed binding pocket and perform a conformational switch in response to ligand binding resulting in altered gene expression. We have utilized the enormous potential of RNA for molecular sensing and conformational changes to develop novel molecular switches with predetermined structural transitions in response to the binding of a small molecule. To validate these in vivo, we exploit the distance-dependent inhibitory potential of secondary structure elements placed close to the bacterial ribosome binding site. We created a translational control element by combining the theophylline aptamer with a helical communication module for which a ligand-dependent one-nucleotide slipping mechanism had been proposed. This structural element was inserted at a position just interfering with translation in the non ligand-bound form. Addition of the ligand then shifts the inhibitory element to a distance which permits efficient translation. We present here a novel regulatory mechanism in the first rationally designed, in vivo active RNA switch. Its use of a slippage mechanism to control gene expression makes it different from natural riboswitches which are based on sequestration or antitermination.},

We developed tetracycline-dependent ribozymes, which can switch on gene expression up to 8.7-fold upon addition of tetracycline. A tetracycline aptamer was grafted onto the hammerhead ribozyme in such a way that ligand binding to the aptamers destroys a loop?loop interaction within the ribozyme thereby inhibiting ribozyme cleavage and allowing gene expression. The advantage of the presented regulatory system is its independence of any regulatory proteins. The stable integration of the ribozyme into the genome of HeLa cells indicates a low background activity in the absence of ligand. Furthermore, the ligand concentration required to robustly flip the switch does not affect cell viability and therefore allows a long-term application of the system. These properties turn the tetracycline-dependent ribozymes into a very promising tool for conditional gene expression in mammalian cells.},

The selected ribozymes have kinetic characteristics that are predicted to be sufficient for cellular gene control applications, but do not exhibit any activity in reporter gene assays. The inability of the engineered RNAs to control gene expression suggests that the in vitro and in vivo folding pathways of the RNAs are different.

A vast array of enhanced-sampling methods are based on the identification and biasing of these low-dimensional order parameters, whose fluctuations are important in driving rare events of interest. Here, we describe a new algorithm for finding optimal low-dimensional CVs for use in enhanced-sampling biasing methods like umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and related methods, when limited prior static and dynamic information is known about the system, and a much larger set of candidate CVs is specified. The algorithm involves estimating the best combination of these candidate CVs, as quantified by a maximum path entropy estimate of the spectral gap for dynamics viewed as a function of that CV. The algorithm is called spectral gap optimization of order parameters (SGOOP). Through multiple practical examples, we show how this postprocessing procedure can lead to optimization of CV and several orders of magnitude improvement in the convergence of the free energy calculated through metadynamics, essentially giving the ability to extract useful information even from unsuccessful metadynamics runs.},

Here, we present the first analysis and optimization of these effects for selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq). We first optimize SHAPE-Seq, and show that it provides highly reproducible reactivity data over a wide range of RNA structural contexts with no apparent biases. As part of this optimization, we present SHAPE-Seq v2.0, a ‘universal’ method that can obtain reactivity information for every nucleotide of an RNA without having to use or introduce a specific reverse transcriptase priming site within the RNA. We show that SHAPE-Seq v2.0 is highly reproducible, with reactivity data that can be used as constraints in RNA folding algorithms to predict structures on par with those generated using data from other SHAPE methods. We anticipate SHAPE-Seq v2.0 to be broadly applicable to understanding the RNA sequence–structure relationship at the heart of some of life's most fundamental processes.},

Through a more comprehensive survey of cations, it was determined that some metal ions (Be2+, Fe3+, Al3+, Ru2+ and Dy2+) are extraordinarily disruptive to the RNA structure and function. Two classes of RNAs examined in greater detail make use of conserved nucleotides within the large internal bulges to form critical structures for allosteric function. One of these classes exhibits a metal-dependent increase in rate constant that indicates a requirement for the binding of two cation effectors. Additional findings suggest that, although complex allosteric functions can be exhibited by small RNAs, larger RNA molecules will probably be required to form binding pockets that are uniquely selective for individual cation effectors.},

Technologies that enable the generation of aptazymes to defined input ligands are of interest for the construction of biocomputing devices and biosensing applications.

Using a sample of 337 couples derived from a longitudinal study of families living in the rural midwest, this study examines the influence of work-family conflict on marital quality and marital stability as it is mediated through psychological distress and quality of marital interaction. We conducted analyses using structural equation modeling procedures, and attempted to control method-varieance biases through the use of multiple informants and multiple methods. Results showed that work-family conflict resulting from husbands' and wives' employment is related positively to the psychological distress of each, and that psychological distress affects marital outcomes both directly and indirectly through its association with greater marital hostility and less marital warmth and supportiveness.},

The RNA binds in the same location on the coat protein as the wild type operator and maintains many of the same RNA−protein interactions. In order to achieve this, the RNA stem loop undergoes a concerted rearrangement of the 3' side while leaving the 5' side and the loop interactions largely unchanged, illustrating the ability of RNA to present similar molecular recognition surfaces from distinct primary and secondary structures.},

Cells engineered for chemical production act as renewable factories and redefine what is possible in industries as diverse as manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and energy. Despite this potential, long and uncertain timelines for biobased product development hinder progress. Engineering cells for chemical production is challenging because the complexity of biology necessitates many attempted designs before an optimal combination of genetic elements or culture conditions is discovered. In this work, we develop a framework that allows design evaluation to be performed with fluorescence such that microbial chemical production can be monitored in real time without the need for sample preparation or laborious analytical techniques., Engineering cells to produce valuable metabolic products is hindered by the slow and laborious methods available for evaluating product concentration. Consequently, many designs go unevaluated, and the dynamics of product formation over time go unobserved. In this work, we develop a framework for observing product formation in real time without the need for sample preparation or laborious analytical methods. We use genetically encoded biosensors derived from small-molecule responsive transcription factors to provide a fluorescent readout that is proportional to the intracellular concentration of a target metabolite. Combining an appropriate biosensor with cells designed to produce a metabolic product allows us to track product formation by observing fluorescence. With individual cells exhibiting fluorescent intensities proportional to the amount of metabolite they produce, high-throughput methods can be used to rank the quality of genetic variants or production conditions. We observe production of several renewable plastic precursors with fluorescent readouts and demonstrate that higher fluorescence is indeed an indicator of higher product titer. Using fluorescence as a guide, we identify process parameters that produce 3-hydroxypropionate at 4.2 g/L, 23-fold higher than previously reported. We also report, to our knowledge, the first engineered route from glucose to acrylate, a plastic precursor with global sales of \$14 billion. Finally, we monitor the production of glucarate, a replacement for environmentally damaging detergents, and muconate, a renewable precursor to polyethylene terephthalate and nylon with combined markets of \$51 billion, in real time, demonstrating that our method is applicable to a wide range of molecules.},

The latter consists of an 8-bp conserved sequence (CS), TATCTGTT, immediately followed by an 8-bp T rich sequence. In this study, elongation complexes of T7 RNA polymerase at various positions of the class II signal and several mutant signals were obtained by stepwise walking on immobilized DNA templates free of the class I signal. Multiple CS-associated conformational changes were observed, starting at the beginning of the signal and occurring sequentially. When the complexes reach the first base pair of the CS–DNA duplex, which is downstream of the RNA–DNA heteroduplex, their stability, as measured by time-course retention of radiolabeled transcripts, markedly decreases. Further elongation leads to an abrupt change in polymerase–RNA interaction. Cross-linking of the polymerase to a 4-thio-UMP incorporated into RNA 8 nucleotides upstream of the 3′ end and just upstream of the heteroduplex is initially strong but diminishes when the polymerase reaches the fourth base pair of the CS. After a further 7-nt elongation, the exposed single-stranded region of nontemplate strand is contracted; RNA in the upstream half of the heteroduplex becomes dissociated, and the CS–DNA duplex is reformed. During the next 5-nt elongation before termination, the CS duplex is prevented from translocation, and the contracted transcription bubble expands only downstream. These findings suggest that the CS duplex plays essential roles by successively binding to polymerase both downstream and upstream of the heteroduplex.},

Previous work in RNA synthetic biology has engineered RNA mechanisms that independently regulate multiple targets and integrate regulatory signals. However, intracellular regulatory networks built with these systems have required proteins to propagate regulatory signals. In this work, we remove this requirement and expand the RNA synthetic biology toolkit by engineering three unique features of the plasmid pT181 antisense-RNA-mediated transcription attenuation mechanism. First, because the antisense RNA mechanism relies on RNA-RNA interactions, we show how the specificity of the natural system can be engineered to create variants that independently regulate multiple targets in the same cell. Second, because the pT181 mechanism controls transcription, we show how independently acting variants can be configured in tandem to integrate regulatory signals and perform genetic logic. Finally, because both the input and output of the attenuator is RNA, we show how these variants can be configured to directly propagate RNA regulatory signals by constructing an RNA-meditated transcriptional cascade. The combination of these three features within a single RNA-based regulatory mechanism has the potential to simplify the design and construction of genetic networks by directly propagating signals as RNA molecules.},

The ssrA peptide targets tagged peptides for proteolysis, ensuring rapid degradation of potentially deleterious truncated polypeptides. Ribosome rescue also facilitates turnover of the damaged messages responsible for translational arrest. Thus, tmRNA increases the fidelity of gene expression by promoting the synthesis of full-length proteins. In addition to serving as a global quality control system, tmRNA also plays important roles in bacterial development, pathogenesis, and environmental stress responses.

Metabolite-sensing mRNAs, or “riboswitches,” specifically interact with small ligands and direct expression of the genes involved in their metabolism. Riboswitches contain sensing “aptamer” modules, capable of ligand-induced structural changes, and downstream regions, harboring expression-controlling elements. We report the crystal structures of the add A-riboswitch and xpt G-riboswitch aptamer modules that distinguish between bound adenine and guanine with exquisite specificity and modulate expression of two different sets of genes. The riboswitches form tuning fork-like architectures, in which the prongs are held in parallel through hairpin loop interactions, and the internal bubble zippers up to form the purine binding pocket. The bound purines are held by hydrogen bonding interactions involving conserved nucleotides along their entire periphery. Recognition specificity is associated with Watson-Crick pairing of the encapsulated adenine and guanine ligands with uridine and cytosine, respectively.},

	abstract = {Author Summary
Riboswitches are RNA-based components that integrate ligand binding and gene regulation to dynamically respond to molecular signals within cells. Natural riboswitches are employed to regulate metabolism and other cellular processes, while synthetic riboswitches have been constructed to expand the sensory and regulatory capabilities exhibited in nature. Characterization studies have revealed that sequence modifications can tune properties of the riboswitch response curve, which links ligand concentration to expression levels. Tunability is critical when matching component properties to the regulatory demands of biological systems; however, the characterization of riboswitch tuning strategies is complicated by the integration of numerous regulatory mechanisms and various processes, such as RNA folding and turnover, that impact riboswitch performance. To develop a generalized framework for examining quantitative aspects of riboswitch tuning, we modeled the kinetics of riboswitch function operating under common regulatory mechanisms. Our results reveal that riboswitch performance is primarily dictated by the competition between reversible and mechanism-specific irreversible rate constants. We demonstrate that practical system restrictions can significantly alter the requirements for riboswitch performance, necessitating a variety of tuning strategies. We developed design principles to guide the construction of synthetic riboswitches and a quantitative framework from which to investigate how natural riboswitches are tuned to meet systems-level regulatory demands.},

	abstract = {Chromosomal integration offers a selection-free alternative to DNA plasmids for expression of foreign proteins and metabolic pathways. Episomal plasmid DNA is convenient but has drawbacks including increased metabolic burden and the requirement for selection in the form of antibiotics. E. coli has long been used for the expression of foreign proteins and for the production of valuable metabolites by expression of complete metabolic pathways. The gene encoding the fluorescent reporter protein mCherry was integrated into four genomic loci on the E. coli chromosome to measure protein expression at each site. Expression levels ranged from 25\% to 500\% compared to the gene expressed on a high-copy plasmid. Modular expression of DNA is one of the most commonly used methods for optimizing metabolite production by metabolic engineering. By combining a recently developed method for integration of large synthetic DNA constructs into the genome, we were able to integrate two foreign pathways into the same four genomic loci. We have demonstrated that only one of the genomic loci resulted in the production of violacein, and that all four loci produced trans-cinnamic acid from the TAL pathway.},

Although there are some techniques available to regulate expression in mammalian cells, they rely on the presence of ligand-sensing transcription factors, making it necessary to generate cell lines or organisms that stably express these regulatory factors. In recent years, mechanisms relying on direct RNA-ligand interactions for controlling gene expression have been both discovered in nature and engineered artificially. Among the latter, RNA switches relying on catalytically active RNA have been described. In principle, ligand-dependent triggering of mRNA self-cleavage should be a universal mechanism in order to control gene expression in a variety of organisms. Nevertheless, no examples of such aptazymes acting as RNA-based switches have been reported so far in mammalian cells. Here we present the theophylline-induced activation of an mRNA-based hammerhead ribozyme, resulting in an off-switch of gene expression. Starting from an artificial aptazyme switch reported to function in bacteria, we identified and optimized important parameters such as artificial start codons and the communicating sequence connecting ribozyme and aptamer, resulting in an RNA switch that allows for controlling transgenic expression in mammalian cells without the need to express a corresponding ligand-sensing transcription factor.},

	abstract = {RNA utilizes many different mechanisms to control gene expression. Among the regulatory elements that respond to external stimuli, riboswitches are a prominent and elegant example. They consist solely of RNA and couple binding of a small molecule ligand to the so-called “aptamer domain” with a conformational change in the downstream “expression platform” which then determines system output. The modular organization of riboswitches and the relative ease with which ligand-binding RNA aptamers can be selected in vitro against almost any molecule have led to the rapid and widespread adoption of engineered riboswitches as artificial genetic control devices in biotechnology and synthetic biology over the past decade. This review highlights proof-of-principle applications to demonstrate the versatility and robustness of engineered riboswitches in regulating gene expression in pro- and eukaryotes. It then focuses on strategies and parameters to identify aptamers that can be integrated into synthetic riboswitches that are functional in vivo, before finishing with a reflection on how to improve the regulatory properties of engineered riboswitches, so that we can not only further expand riboswitch applicability, but also finally fully exploit their potential as control elements in regulating gene expression.},

The only natural allosteric ribozyme reported to date catalyzes an RNA cleavage reaction, and so do almost all artificial systems. RNA has, however, been shown to accelerate a much wider range of chemical reactions. Here we report that RNA catalysts for organic reactions can be put under the stringent control of effector molecules by straight-forward rational design. This approach uses known RNA sequences with catalytic and ligand-binding properties, and exploits weakly conserved sequence elements and available structural information to induce the formation of alternative, catalytically inactive structures. The potential and general applicability is demonstrated by the design of three different systems in which the rate of a catalytic carbon–carbon bond forming reaction is positively regulated up to 2100-fold by theophylline, tobramycin and a specific mRNA sequence, respectively. Although smaller in size than a tRNA, all three ribozymes show typical features of allosteric metabolic enzymes, namely high rate acceleration and tight allosteric regulation. Not only do these findings demonstrate RNA's power as a catalyst, but also highlight on RNA's capabilities as signaling components in regulatory networks.},

For this purpose, a TetR protein-inhibiting aptamer was engineered for use in mammalian cells, enabling the RNA-responsive control of the tetracycline-dependent transactivator (tTA). By rationally attaching the theophylline aptamer as a sensor, the inhibitory TetR aptamer and thus tTA activity became dependent on the ligand of the sensor aptamer. Addition of the small molecule theophylline resulted in enhanced binding to the corresponding protein in vitro and in inhibition of reporter gene expression in mammalian cell lines. By using aptamers as adaptors in order to control protein activity by a predetermined small molecule, we present a simple and straightforward approach for future applications in the field of Chemical Biology. Moreover, aptamer-based control of the widely used Tet system introduces a new layer of regulation thereby facilitating the construction of more complex gene networks.},

Most notably, they called for the abandonment of interventions that promote active listening, they concluded that anger was not detrimental to marital outcomes, and they advocated an interaction pattern wherein wives raise issues more gently and husbands more readily accept wives' influence. Because of several methodological and conceptual shortcomings, the recommendations of Gottman et al. appear to us to be premature at best. We raise methodological concerns about the nonrandom selection of research subjects, failure to control for factors that may have differentiated couples initially, procedural issues regarding observational and physiological data, and ambiguity about statistical tests employed. We raise conceptual concerns about how the labeling of patterns affects the conclusions drawn and also about the use of correlational data to make strong causal inferences. We conclude that the article by Gottman et al. risks influencing couples and practitioners alike in a manner that, in our view, exceeds the scope and methods of the underlying research.},

	abstract = {From a culinary perspective, salt has many desirable properties. Added salt improves the sensory properties of virtually every food that humans consume, and it is cheap. There are many reasons for adding salt to foods. The main reason is that, in many cases, added salt enhances the positive sensory attributes of foods, even some otherwise unpalatable foods; it makes them “taste” better. For people who are accustomed to high levels of salt in their food, its abrupt absence can make foods “taste” bad. If we are to successfully lower salt consumption in the population as a whole, it will be necessary to reduce salt levels in the human food supply with careful attention to their flavor-enhancing properties. Consideration of what is known about the effects of salt on food and flavor perception and why people like foods with added salt can help to inform efforts to lower salt consumption. Further, knowledge of how salt is detected by sensory receptors may aid in developing salt substitutes or enhancers that could contribute to an overall reduction of salt in the food supply.},

In contrast to some existing communication modules, the novel 9-nt RNA element is demonstrated to function similarly between a variety of catalysts that include the hepatitis delta virus, hammerhead, X motif and Tetrahymena group I ribozymes, and various ligand-binding domains. The data support a mechanistic model of RNA folding in which the element is comprised of both canonical and non-canonical base pairs and an unpaired nucleotide in the active, effector-bound conformation. Aside from enabling effector-controlled RNA function through rational design, the element can be utilized to identify sites in large RNAs that are susceptible to effector regulation.},

	abstract = {An allosteric ribozyme has been designed using the hammerhead ribozyme as the active site and aflavin-specific RNA aptamer as a regulatory site. We constructed six variants with a series of base pairs in the linker region (stem II). Under single turnover conditions, kinetic studies were carried out in the absence and presence of flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Interestingly, FMN addition did not influence the cleavage rate of constructs with a 5-6 bp linker but stimulated the catalytic activity of those bearing a shorter linker. In particular, the apparent k cat of Rz3 increases by approximately 10-fold upon addition of saturating amounts of FMN. To determine the rate constants( K m4and k cat), the ribozyme regulated most effectively by FMN was further investigated. FMN mainly affected the k cat value, reflecting the rate limiting conformational change step of the overall cleavage reaction, depending on helix formation in stem II. Probably, FMN influences the orientation of structures necessary for the cleavage reaction through stem II formation. The result of chemical modification revealed that binding of FMN to the aptamer domain induced the helix formation in stem II required for catalytic activity. Therefore, a specific FMN-mediated allosteric interaction seems to promote a conformational alteration from an open to a closed structure in stem II. The concept of conformational modification in the allosteric effect is consistent with other allosteric enzymes, suggesting that such a conformational change is a fundamental feature of allosteric enzymes in biological systems.},

In this study we address structural and thermodynamic features of such interactions by using a simple model system: the binding of the highly charged antibiotic neomycin B to a short hairpin RNA molecule. Nucleotide A16, which acts as a flap over the neomycin B binding pocket, was substituted by the fluorescent adenine analogue 2-aminopurine (2-AP). Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements were complemented by UV-melting and circular dichroism studies. The binding of neomycin B at three sites was found to have a strong inverse correlation with Na+ concentration. For the highest-affinity site, both fluorescence and UV absorption experiments were consistent with a model assuming at least three neomycin NH3+ groups participating in addition to hydrogen bonds in electrostatic interactions with the RNA. The variation of fluorescence intensity and lifetime upon neomycin B binding indicated unstacking of 2-AP16 from neighbouring bases as it flipped over the binding pocket. RNA conformational changes upon binding of the antibiotic were confirmed by circular dichroism. The two weaker binding sites were characterized as unspecific binding to the aptamer, while the high-affinity binding event was shown to be highly specific even at high ionic concentration. In addition, 2-AP was confirmed to be a noninvasive fluorescent probe; it serves as a sensitive spectroscopic tool to investigate details of the interactions between small molecules and RNA.},

We present a robust, general, scalable system, called 'Boolean logic and arithmetic through DNA excision' (BLADE), to engineer genetic circuits with multiple inputs and outputs in mammalian cells with minimal optimization. The reliability of BLADE arises from its reliance on recombinases under the control of a single promoter, which integrates circuit signals on a single transcriptional layer. We used BLADE to build 113 circuits in human embryonic kidney and Jurkat T cells and devised a quantitative, vector-proximity metric to evaluate their performance. Of 113 circuits analyzed, 109 functioned (96.5\%) as intended without optimization. The circuits, which are available through Addgene, include a 3-input, two-output full adder; a 6-input, one-output Boolean logic look-up table; circuits with small-molecule-inducible control; and circuits that incorporate CRISPR–Cas9 to regulate endogenous genes. BLADE enables execution of sophisticated cellular computation in mammalian cells, with applications in cell and tissue engineering.},

	abstract = {Mammalian cells are able to repair chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs) both by homologous recombination and by mechanisms that require little or no homology. Although spontaneous homologous recombination is rare, DSBs will stimulate recombination by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude when homology is provided either from exogenous DNA in gene-targeting experiments or from a repeated chromosomal sequence. Using a gene-targeting assay in mouse embryonic stem cells, we now investigate the effect of heterology on recombinational repair of DSBs. Cells were cotransfected with an endonuclease expression plasmid to induce chromosomal DSBs and with substrates containing up to 1.2\% heterology from which to repair the DSBs. We find that heterology decreases the efficiency of recombinational repair, with 1.2\% sequence divergence resulting in an approximately sixfold reduction in recombination. Gene conversion tract lengths were examined in 80 recombinants. Relatively short gene conversion tracts were observed, with 80\% of the recombinants having tracts of 58 bp or less. These results suggest that chromosome ends in mammalian cells are generally protected from extensive degradation prior to recombination. Gene conversion tracts that were long (up to 511 bp) were continuous, i.e., they contained an uninterrupted incorporation of the silent mutations. This continuity suggests that these long tracts arose from extensive degradation of the ends or from formation of heteroduplex DNA which is corrected with a strong bias in the direction of the unbroken strand.},

The fluorescence of Escherichia coli cells expressing each of eighteen proteins from Pyrobaculum aerophilum as fusions with superfolder GFP was proportional to total protein expression. In contrast, fluorescence of folding reporter GFP fusion proteins was strongly correlated with the productive folding yield of the passenger protein.

These results open the possibility of using the SELEX technique to generate RNA molecules as diagnostic tools for the detection of DNA damaging compounds and ultimately DNA adducts.},

RNA aptamers are capable of inhibiting proteins with high affinity and specificity, but this effect is not readily reversible. We describe a general method for discovering aptamers that bind and inhibit their target protein, but addition of a specific small molecule disrupts the protein-RNA complex. A SELEX protocol was used to raise RNA aptamers to the DNA repair enzyme, formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (Fpg), and neomycin was employed in each round to dissociate Fpg-bound RNAs. We identified an RNA molecule able to completely inhibit Fpg at 100 nM concentration. Importantly, Fpg activity is recovered by the addition of neomycin. We envision these ligand-regulated aptamers (LIRAs) as valuable tools in the study of biological phenomena in which the timing of molecular events is critical.},

	abstract = {Synthetic RNA-based switches are a growing class of genetic controllers applied in synthetic biology to engineer cellular functions. In this chapter, we detail a protocol for the selection of posttranscriptional controllers of gene expression in yeast using the Schistosoma mansoni hammerhead ribozyme as a central catalytic unit. Incorporation of a small molecule-sensing aptamer domain into the ribozyme renders its activity ligand-dependent. Aptazymes display numerous advantages over conventional protein-based transcriptional controllers, namely, the use of little genomic space for encryption, their modular architecture allowing for easy reprogramming to new inputs, the physical linkage to the message to be controlled, and the ability to function without protein cofactors. Herein, we describe the method to select ribozyme-based switches of gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that we successfully implemented to engineer neomycin- and theophylline-responsive switches. We also highlight how to adapt the protocol to screen for switches responsive to other ligands. Reprogramming of the sensor unit and incorporation into any RNA of interest enables the fulfillment of a variety of regulatory functions. However, proper functioning of the aptazyme is largely dependent on optimal connection between the aptamer and the catalytic core. We obtained functional switches from a pool of variants carrying randomized connection sequences by an in vivo selection in MaV203 yeast cells that allows screening of a large sequence space of up to 1 × 109 variants. The protocol given explains how to construct aptazyme libraries, carry out the in vivo selection and characterize novel ON- and OFF-switches.},

	abstract = {In times of low wheat reserves, newly harvested wheat is processed almost immediately after harvest, which presents a series of problems to the millers and bakers. Newly harvested wheat generally has poor milling and baking quality. However, after wheat is aged, the bran is easier to separate from the endosperm, flour extraction increases, and ash content drops. These improvements have been related to posthar‐vest maturation and physical changes in the wheat kernel. On the other side of the milling process, freshly milled flour does not perform as well as flour that has been kept in storage. To address this issue, extra flour storage capacity is needed, or millers and bakers must add chemicals to their flours. Flour components change during aging. Aged soft wheat flour behaves similarly to chlorinated flour. Flour hydration rate and batter viscosity increase, and cakes have greater volumes without collapse. Aged hard wheat flour has higher water absorption, better mixing tolerance, and greater gas retention capability and produces bread with greater loaf volume. This review compiles the published studies related to wheat and flour aging.},

Accordingly, 14 couples that had marital conflicts were chosen from two counselling centre of the Shiraz city by screening. Couples were randomly assigned in two groups, including an experimental (7 couples) and a control (7 couples) groups. All of the participants completed Intimacy Needs Questionnaire. After one week treatment sessions were executed on the experimental group. The experimental group received 8-10 sessions of emotionally focused couple therapy that each session lasted two hours. One week after the end of treatment sessions, the participants completed the questionnaire again .T-test results of pre-test and post-test revealed that there is a significant difference between the two groups in intimacy. Further results (MANOVA) showed that EFCT increased emotional, psychological, sexual, physical, relationship, temporal and intellectual intimacy, but there was no significant difference between the two groups in social-recreational and spiritual intimacy. Authors concluded that EFCT increased intimacy in experimental group compared with the control group. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Equilibrium and kinetic analyses have been performed to elucidate the roles of dimerization in folding and stability of KSI from Pseudomonas putida biotype B. Folding was reversible in secondary and tertiary structures as well as in activity. Equilibrium unfolding transition, as monitored by fluorescence and ellipticity measurements, could be modeled by a two-state mechanism without thermodynamically stable intermediates. Consistent with the two-state model, one dimensional (1D) NMR spectra and gel-filtration chromatography analysis did not show any evidence for a folded monomeric intermediate. Interestingly enough, Cys 81 located at the dimeric interface was modified by DTNB before unfolding. This inconsistent result might be explained by increased dynamic motion of the interface residues in the presence of urea to expose Cys 81 more frequently without the dimer dissociation. The refolding process, as monitored by fluorescence change, could best be described by five kinetic phases, in which the second phase was a bimolecular step. Because {\textless}30\% of the total fluorescence change occurred during the first step, most of the native tertiary structure may be driven to form by the bimolecular step. During the refolding process, negative ellipticity at 225 nm increased very fast within 80 msec to account for {\textgreater}80\% of the total amplitude. This result suggests that the protein folds into a monomer containing most of the α-helical structures before dimerization. Monitoring the enzyme activity during the refolding process could estimate the activity of the monomer that is not fully active. Together, these results stress the importance of dimerization in the formation and maintenance of the functional native tertiary structure.},

Here, we use recently devised sgRNA design rules to create human and mouse genome-wide libraries, perform positive and negative selection screens and observe that the use of these rules produced improved results.

Thus, it is important to understand which couples respond best to the intervention and which couples respond less well. E. A. Schilling, D. H. Baucom, C. K. Burnett, E. A. Allen, and L. Ragland (2003) unexpectedly found that the more women increased positive communication in response to PREP, the more likely they were to become distressed in the subsequent 5 years. The current study explores similar issues, investigating a relationship education program in Germany. The current results indicate that couples are susceptible to future relationship distress if women demonstrate extreme increases in positive and decreases in negative communication after intervention.

In this study, we adopted a mechanism-guided approach to design libraries predisposed to contain OFF riboswitches that respond to thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). The first library design exploited a pseudo-Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence located near the 3′-end of the TPP aptamer, which would be less accessible to the ribosome when the aptamer is bound to TPP. In the second library, an SD sequence was strategically placed in the aptamer's P1 stem, which is stabilized upon ligand binding. OFF riboswitches were obtained by dual genetic selection of these libraries. The results underscore the importance of effective library design to achieve desired riboswitch functions.},

These RNA molecular switches were created by a new combinatorial strategy termed 'allosteric selection,' which favors the emergence of ribozymes that rapidly self-cleave only when incubated with their corresponding effector compounds. Representative RNAs exhibit 5,000-fold activation upon cGMP or cAMP addition, display precise molecular recognition characteristics, and operate with catalytic rates that match those exhibited by unaltered ribozymes. These findings demonstrate that a vast number of ligand-responsive ribozymes with dynamic structural characteristics can be generated in a massively parallel fashion.

We have directly measured the dynamics of the electric field in the active site of a highly proficient enzyme, Δ5-3-ketosteroid isomerase (KSI), in response to a sudden electrostatic perturbation that simulates the charge displacement that occurs along the KSI catalytic reaction coordinate. Photoexcitation of a fluorescent analog (coumarin 183) of the reaction intermediate mimics the change in charge distribution that occurs between the reactant and intermediate state in the steroid substrate of KSI. We measured the electrostatic response and angular dynamics of four probe dipoles in the enzyme active site by monitoring the time-resolved changes in the vibrational absorbance (IR) spectrum of a spectator thiocyanate moiety (a quantitative sensor of changes in electric field) placed at four different locations in and around the active site, using polarization-dependent transient vibrational Stark spectroscopy. The four different dipoles in the active site remain immobile and do not align to the changes in the substrate electric field. These results indicate that the active site of KSI is preorganized with respect to functionally relevant changes in electric fields.},

The presence of this motif is sufficient to support cleavage at high Mg2+ concentrations, but not at the low Mg2+ concentrations characteristic of intracellular environments. Here we demonstrate that natural HHRzs require the presence of additional nonconserved sequence elements outside of the conserved catalytic core to enable intracellular activity. These elements may stabilize the HHRz in a catalytically active conformation via tertiary interactions. HHRzs stabilized by these interactions cleave efficiently at physiological Mg2+ concentrations and are functional in vivo. The proposed role of these tertiary interacting motifs is supported by mutational, functional, structural and molecular modeling analysis of natural HHRzs.},

NMR and 2-aminopurine fluorescence studies of the aptamer identified a flexible pentaloop that provides adaptation to external influences on its structure and a stable binding pocket., Aptamers can be highly specific for their targets, which implies precise molecular recognition between aptamer and target. However, as small polymers, their structures are more subject to environmental conditions than the more constrained longer RNAs such as those that constitute the ribosome. To understand the balance between structural and environmental factors in establishing ligand specificity of aptamers, we examined the RNA aptamer (NEO1A) previously reported as specific for neomycin-B. We show that NEO1A can recognize other aminoglycosides with similar affinities as for neomycin-B and its aminoglycoside specificity is strongly influenced by ionic strength and buffer composition. NMR and 2-aminopurine (2AP) fluorescence studies of the aptamer identified a flexible pentaloop and a stable binding pocket. Consistent with a well-structured binding pocket, docking analysis results correlated with experimental measures of the binding energy for most ligands. Steady state fluorescence studies of 2AP-substituted aptamers confirmed that A16 moves to a more solvent accessible position upon ligand binding while A14 moves to a less solvent accessible position, which is most likely a base stack. Analysis of binding affinities of NEO1A sequence variants showed that the base in position 16 interacts differently with each ligand and the interaction is a function of the buffer constituents. Our results show that the pentaloop provides NEO1A with the ability to adapt to external influences on its structure, with the critical base at position 16 adjusting to incorporate each ligand into a stable pocket by hydrophobic interactions and/or hydrogen bonds depending on the ligand and the ionic environment.},

A wide variety of DNA nanostructures have been assembled by folding long DNA single strands with short DNA staples. However, such structures typically need annealing at elevated temperatures in order to form. To accommodate the formation of such structures in living cells, Praetorius and Dietz developed an approach in which custom protein staples based on transcription activator–like effector proteins fold double-stranded DNA templates (see the Perspective by Douglas). The structures folded into user-defined geometric shapes on the scale of tens to hundreds of nanometers. These nanostructures could self-assemble at room temperature in physiological buffers.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONControlling the spatial arrangement of functional components in biological systems on the scale of higher-order macromolecular assemblies is an important goal in synthetic biology. Achieving this goal could yield new research tools and pave the way for interesting applications in health and biotechnology. DNA origami enables constructing arbitrary shapes on the desired scale by folding a single-stranded DNA “scaffold” into user-defined shapes using a set of “staple” oligonucleotides, but single-stranded DNA is typically not available in living cells, and the structures usually assemble only at nonphysiological temperatures. The scope of functions that can be fulfilled by DNA itself appears so far still limited. Proteins, on the other hand, offer a large variety of functionalities and are easily accessible in cells through genetic encoding, but designing larger structural frameworks from proteins alone remains challenging.
RATIONALEHere, we reimagined DNA origami to explore the possibility for using a set of designed proteins to fold a double-stranded DNA template into user-defined DNA-protein hybrid objects with dimensions on the desired 10- to 100-nm scale. To realize our idea, we require synthetic DNA “looping” proteins that can link two user-defined double-helical DNA sequences, and we need to determine suitable rules for arranging both the template and multiple of such staple proteins in the context of a larger target structure. Transcription activator–like (TAL) effector proteins are produced by plant pathogenic bacteria and injected into host cells, where they bind to specific promoter regions, thus controlling the expression of target genes. The DNA recognizing part of a TAL effector consists of an array of repeat subunits that binds to the major groove of double-helical DNA, thus forming a superhelix. Each repeat subunit comprises {\textasciitilde}34 amino acids and recognizes a single DNA base pair. Because of their modular architecture, TAL effectors can be engineered to bind to user-defined DNA sequences, and this technique is currently being exploited for genome engineering applications. For constructing the staple proteins, we therefore chose the DNA-recognizing domains of TAL effectors.
RESULTSWe characterized the DNA-recognizing domains of the TAL effectors with respect to binding affinity and sequence specificity. To construct the staple proteins, we fused two TAL proteins via a custom peptide linker and tested for the ability to connect two separate double-helical DNA domains. For creating larger objects containing multiple staple protein connections, we identified a set of rules regarding the optimal spacing between these connections. On the basis of these rules, we could create megadalton-scale objects that realize a variety of structural motifs, such as custom curvatures, vertices, and corners. Each of those objects was built from a set of 12 double-TAL staple proteins and a template DNA double strand with designed sequence. We also tested design principles for multilayer structures with enhanced rigidity. All components of our nanostructures can be genetically encoded and self-assemble isothermally at room temperature in near-physiological buffer conditions. The staple proteins used in this work also carried a green fluorescent protein domain that serves as a placeholder for a variety of functional protein domains that can be genetically fused to the staple proteins. We were also able to demonstrate formation of our structures starting from genetic expression in a one-pot reaction mixture that contained the double-stranded DNA scaffold, the genes encoding the staple proteins, RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and cofactors for transcription and translation. Successful self-assembly of our hybrid nanostructures was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy.
CONCLUSIONBy using our system of designing double-TAL staple proteins that fold a template DNA double strand, researchers can control the spatial arrangement of protein domains in custom geometries. Our system should have a good chance to work inside cells, given the success of our in vitro expression experiments and considering that the DNA binding properties of TAL are preserved inside cells, as seen in gene editing experiments with TAL-based endonucleases. Because TAL-based staple proteins can be tailored to specifically recognize any desired DNA target sequence, these proteins could then be used to create custom structures and loops in genomic DNA to study the relation between genome architecture and gene expression, or to position proteins involved in other intracellular processes in user-defined ways. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/355/6331/eaam5488/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Schematic illustration of the self-assembly of DNA-protein hybrid objects from a set of 12 double-TAL staple proteins and a template DNA double strand.Depending on the sequence of the template, the resulting object may be a square (top) or a double-ring circle (bottom). In total, we designed 18 different protein hybrid objects using this principle. Scale bar, 20 nm.
We describe an approach to bottom-up fabrication that allows integration of the functional diversity of proteins into designed three-dimensional structural frameworks. A set of custom staple proteins based on transcription activator–like effector proteins folds a double-stranded DNA template into a user-defined shape. Each staple protein is designed to recognize and closely link two distinct double-helical DNA sequences at separate positions on the template. We present design rules for constructing megadalton-scale DNA-protein hybrid shapes; introduce various structural motifs, such as custom curvature, corners, and vertices; and describe principles for creating multilayer DNA-protein objects with enhanced rigidity. We demonstrate self-assembly of our hybrid nanostructures in one-pot mixtures that include the genetic information for the designed proteins, the template DNA, RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and cofactors for transcription and translation.
Folding DNA double strands using custom staple proteins can form megadalton-scale nanostructures with user-defined shapes.

Here we report our study on the conformational dynamics of horseradish peroxidase using single-molecule multiparameter photon time-stamping spectroscopy with mechanical force manipulation, a newly developed single-molecule fluorescence imaging magnetic tweezers nanoscopic approach. A nascent-formed fluorogenic product molecule serves as a probe, perfectly fitting in the enzymatic reaction active site for probing the enzymatic conformational dynamics. Interestingly, the product releasing dynamics shows the complex conformational behavior with multiple product releasing pathways. However, under magnetic force manipulation, the complex nature of the multiple product releasing pathways disappears and more simplistic conformations of the active site are populated.},

In this report, we describe the first application of this technology to regulate an endogenous gene in mammalian cells. As a proof-of-concept demonstration we chose to modulate expression of albumin—serum protein produced by the liver. We designed and constructed a theophylline aptamer-fused short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vector targeting albumin mRNA in hepatic (HepG2) cells. Transfection of HepG2 cells with the aptamer–shRNA expression vector allowed to control albumin gene expression by adding theophylline into the culture media in dose dependent fashion.},

	abstract = {We have developed a method for isolation of random peptides that inhibit intracellular processes in bacteria. A library of random peptides expressed as fusions to Escherichia coli thioredoxin (aptamers) were expressed under the tight control of the arabinose-inducible PBAD promoter. A selection was applied to the library to isolate aptamers that interfered with the activity of thymidylate synthase (ThyA) in vivo. Expression of an aptamer isolated by this method resulted in a ThyA− phenotype that was suppressed by simultaneous overexpression of ThyA. Two-hybrid analysis showed that this aptamer is likely to interact with ThyA in vivo. The library also was screened for aptamers that inhibited growth of bacteria expressing them, and five such aptamers were characterized. Four aptamers were bacteriostatic when expressed, whereas one showed a bactericidal effect. Introduction of translational stop codons into various aptamers blocked their activity, suggesting that their biological effects were likely to be due to protein aptamer rather than RNA. Combinatorial aptamers provide a new genetic and biochemical tool for identifying targets for antibacterial drug development.},

While synthetic RNA-based regulatory systems that integrate regulatory and sensing functions have been demonstrated, the lack of detail on miRNA structure–function relationships has limited the development of integrated control systems based on miRNA silencing. Using an elucidated relationship between Drosha processing and the single-stranded nature of the miRNA basal segments, we developed a strategy for designing ligand-responsive miRNAs. We demonstrate that ligand binding to an aptamer integrated into the miRNA basal segments inhibits Drosha processing, resulting in titratable control over gene silencing. The generality of this control strategy was shown for three aptamer–small molecule ligand pairs. The platform can be extended to the design of synthetic miRNAs clusters, cis-acting miRNAs and self-targeting miRNAs that act both in cis and trans, enabling fine-tuning of the regulatory strength and dynamics. The ability of our ligand-responsive miRNA platform to respond to user-defined inputs, undergo regulatory performance tuning and display scalable combinatorial control schemes will help advance applications in biological research and applied medicine.},

	abstract = {Here, we systematically decompose the known protein structural universe into its basic elements, which we dub tertiary structural motifs (TERMs). A TERM is a compact backbone fragment that captures the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary environments around a given residue, comprising one or more disjoint segments (three on average). We seek the set of universal TERMs that capture all structure in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), finding remarkable degeneracy. Only ∼600 TERMs are sufficient to describe 50\% of the PDB at sub-Angstrom resolution. However, more rare geometries also exist, and the overall structural coverage grows logarithmically with the number of TERMs. We go on to show that universal TERMs provide an effective mapping between sequence and structure. We demonstrate that TERM-based statistics alone are sufficient to recapitulate close-to-native sequences given either NMR or X-ray backbones. Furthermore, sequence variability predicted from TERM data agrees closely with evolutionary variation. Finally, locations of TERMs in protein chains can be predicted from sequence alone based on sequence signatures emergent from TERM instances in the PDB. For multisegment motifs, this method identifies spatially adjacent fragments that are not contiguous in sequence—a major bottleneck in structure prediction. Although all TERMs recur in diverse proteins, some appear specialized for certain functions, such as interface formation, metal coordination, or even water binding. Structural biology has benefited greatly from previously observed degeneracies in structure. The decomposition of the known structural universe into a finite set of compact TERMs offers exciting opportunities toward better understanding, design, and prediction of protein structure.},

	abstract = {A series of allosteric ribozymes that respond to the bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanosyl-5?-monophosphate (c-di-GMP) have been created by using in vitro selection. An RNA library was generated by using random-sequence bridges to join a hammerhead self-cleaving ribozyme to an aptamer from a natural c-di-GMP riboswitch. Specific bridge sequences, called communication modules, emerged through two in vitro selection efforts that either activate or inhibit ribozyme self-cleavage upon ligand binding to the aptamer. Representative RNAs were found that exhibit EC50 (half-maximal effective concentration) values for c-di-GMP as low as 90 nM and IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) values as low as 180 nM. The allosteric RNAs display molecular recognition characteristics that mimic the high discriminatory ability of the natural aptamer. Some engineered RNAs operate with ribozyme rate constants approaching that of the parent hammerhead ribozyme. By use of these allosteric ribozymes, cytoplasmic concentrations of c-di-GMP in three mutant strains of Escherichia coli were quantitatively estimated from cell lysates. Our findings demonstrate that engineered c-di-GMP-sensing ribozymes can be used as convenient tools to monitor c-di-GMP levels from complex biological or chemical samples. Moreover, these ribozymes could be employed in high-throughput screens to identify compounds that trigger c-di-GMP riboswitch function.},

	abstract = {When thinking about RNA three-dimensional structures, coming across GNRA and UNCG tetraloops is perceived as a boon since their folds have been extensively described. Nevertheless, analyzing loop conformations within RNA and RNP structures led us to uncover several instances of GNRA and UNCG loops that do not fold as expected. We noticed that when a GNRA does not assume its “natural” fold, it adopts the one we typically associate with a UNCG sequence. The same folding interconversion occurs for loops with UNCG sequences, for instance within tRNA anticodon loops. In addition, we show that some structured tetranucleotide sequences starting with G or U can adopt either of these folds. The underlying structural basis that defines these two fold types is the mutually exclusive stacking of a backbone oxygen atom on either the first (in GNRA) or the last nucleobase (in UNCG), generating an oxygen-π contact. We thereby propose to refrain from using sequences to distinguish between loop conformations. Instead, we suggest to use descriptors such as U-turn (for ‘GNRA-type’ folds) and a newly described Z-turn (for ‘UNCG-type’ folds). Because tetraloops adopt for the largest part only two (inter)convertible turns, we are better able to interpret from a structural perspective loop interchangeability as reported in ribosomes and viral RNA. In this respect, we propose a general view on the prevalence for a sequence to adopt (or not) a given fold. We also gain insights into how long non-coding RNAs may adopt discrete but transient structures, which are therefore hard to predict.},

One hundred and one couples from two studies, in which the effectiveness of the EPL (Ein Partnerschaftliches Lernprogramm für Paare [A Learning Program for Married Couples]) was investigated, were followed-up 11 years after the training. In the first study, EPL-takers had a significantly lower divorce and separation rate (27.5\%) than non-EPL-takers (52.6\%). This finding was replicated in a second study, showing a 20\% dissolution rate in EPL-takers. For those couples still together, the rate of happy relationships was 80\% at the eleven-year follow-up – thus, there is optimism for longer married couples who are willing to focus on improving their relationships.

	abstract = {Background: Efficient operation of cellular processes relies on the strict control that each cell exerts over its metabolic pathways. Some protein enzymes are subject to allosteric regulation, in which binding sites located apart from the enzyme's active site can specifically recognize effector molecules and alter the catalytic rate of the enzyme via conformational changes. Although RNA also performs chemical reactions, no ribozymes are known to operate as true allosteric enzymes in biological systems. It has recently been established that small-molecule receptors can readily be made of RNA, as demonstrated by the in vitro selection of various RNA aptamers that can specifically bind corresponding ligand molecules. We set out to examine whether the catalytic activity of an existing ribozyme could be brought under the control of an effector molecule by designing conjoined aptamer-ribozyme complexes., Results: By joining an ATP-binding RNA to a self-cleaving ribozyme, we have created the first example of an allosteric ribozyme that has a catalytic rate that can be controlled by ATP. A 180-fold reduction in rate is observed upon addition of either adenosine or ATP, but no inhibition is detected in the presence of dATP or other nucleoside triphosphates. Mutations in the aptamer domain that are expected to eliminate ATP binding or that increase the distance between aptamer and ribozyme domains result in a loss of ATP-specific allosteric control. Using a similar design approach, allosteric hammerhead ribozymes that are activated in the presence of ATP were created and another ribozyme that can be controlled by theophylline was created., Conclusions: The catalytic features of these conjoined aptamer-ribozyme constructs demonstrate that catalytic RNAs can also be subject to allosteric regulation — a key feature of certain protein enzymes. Moreover, by using simple rational design strategies, it is now possible to engineer new catalytic polynucleotides which have rates that can be tightly and specifically controlled by small effector molecules.},

However, significant advancements in our ability to engineer biological systems have been limited by the foundational tools available for reporting on, responding to, and controlling intracellular components in living systems. Portable and scalable platforms are needed for the reliable construction of such communication and control systems across diverse organisms. We report an extensible RNA-based framework for engineering ligand-controlled gene-regulatory systems, called ribozyme switches, that exhibits tunable regulation, design modularity, and target specificity. These switch platforms contain a sensor domain, comprised of an aptamer sequence, and an actuator domain, comprised of a hammerhead ribozyme sequence. We examined two modes of standardized information transmission between these domains and demonstrate a mechanism that allows for the reliable and modular assembly of functioning synthetic RNA switches and regulation of ribozyme activity in response to various effectors. In addition to demonstrating examples of small molecule-responsive, in vivo functional, allosteric hammerhead ribozymes, this work describes a general approach for the construction of portable and scalable gene-regulatory systems. We demonstrate the versatility of the platform in implementing application-specific control systems for small molecule-mediated regulation of cell growth and noninvasive in vivo sensing of metabolite production.},

A tobramycin-based affinity cleavage reagent specifically cleaves the aptamers in their consensus regions. A fluorescence depolarization method is developed to accurately measure the affinity and stoichiometry of aminoglycoside binding to RNA constructs. An RNA aptamer (J6RNA) selected to bind to the aminoglycoside antibiotic tobramycin is shown to do so with an affinity of 0.77 nM and a stoichiometry of 1:1. (Fluorescently labeled) 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine tobramycin (CRT) is used as a ligand in the fluorescence depolarization studies. J6RNA binding is quite specific for tobramycin, and weakly binds structurally related aminoglycosides with affinities 103−104-fold lower than that for tobramycin.

	abstract = {Flow cytometry data analysis routinely includes the use of one- or two-parameter histograms to visualize the data. These histograms have traditionally been plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. However, the recent trend of performing the logarithmic conversion in software has made apparent some limitations of the traditional visual presentation of logarithmic data. This review discusses the mathematics of presenting data on a histogram and emphasizes the difference between scaling and binning. The review introduces the concept of an effective resolution to describe how the bin width changes in a variable bin-width histogram. The change in effective resolution is used to explain the commonly observed valley and picket fencing artifacts. These result from the effective resolution of the display histogram being too high for the data being presented. Recently, several different binning transformations have been described that are becoming more popular because they allow one to view a large dynamic range of data on a single plot, while allowing the display of negative data values. While each of the transforms is based upon different equations, they all exhibit very similar properties. All of the transforms bin the data logarithmically at high channel values and linearly at low channel values. The linear scaling of the lower channels serves to limit the effective resolution of the histogram, thus minimizing the valley and picket fencing artifacts. The newer transformations are not without their own limitations and recommendations for the appropriate manner of presenting flow cytometry data using these newer transformations are discussed. © 2008 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

We have carried out in-depth interrogations of the proton transfer equilibrium within a hydrogen bond network formed to bound phenols in the active site of ketosteroid isomerase. We systematically varied the proton affinity of the phenol using differing electron-withdrawing substituents and incorporated site-specific NMR and IR probes to quantitatively map the proton and charge rearrangements within the network that accompany incremental increases in phenol proton affinity. The observed ionization changes were accurately described by a simple equilibrium proton transfer model that strongly suggests the intrinsic proton affinity of one of the Tyr residues in the network, Tyr16, does not remain constant but rather systematically increases due to weakening of the phenol–Tyr16 anion hydrogen bond with increasing phenol proton affinity. Using vibrational Stark spectroscopy, we quantified the electrostatic field changes within the surrounding active site that accompany these rearrangements within the network. We were able to model these changes accurately using continuum electrostatic calculations, suggesting a high degree of conformational restriction within the protein matrix. Our study affords direct insight into the physical and energetic properties of a hydrogen bond network within a protein interior and provides an example of a highly controlled system with minimal conformational rearrangements in which the observed physical changes can be accurately modeled by theoretical calculations.},

	abstract = {Background: It has been hypothesized that the fact that both ribosomal RNA and the group I intron can bind to aminoglycoside antibiotics implies that these RNAs are evolutionarily related. This hypothesis requires the assumption that there are relatively few ways for RNA molecules to form aminoglycoside-binding sites. Results: We have used in vitro selection to determine the diversity of aminoglycoside-binding sites that can be formed by RNA molecules. We have generated RNA ‘lectins’ that can bind aminoglycosides tightly and specifically. Sequence analysis indicates that there are many different ways to form tight and specific aminoglycoside binding sites. These artificially selected binding sites are functionally similar to those that have arisen from natural selection. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the presence of aminoglycoside-binding sites on RNA molecules may not be a useful trait for determining evolutionary relatedness. Instead, the fact that RNA molecules can bind these ‘low molecular-weight effectors’ may indicate that natural products such as aminoglycosides have evolved to exploit sequence- and structure-specific recognition of nucleic acids, in much the same way that lexitropsins have been designed by chemists to recognise specific nucleic acid sequences.},

	abstract = {Recent studies on the control of specific metabolic pathways in bacteria have documented the existence of entirely RNA-based mechanisms for controlling gene expression. These mechanisms involve the modulation of translation, transcription termination or RNA self-cleavage through the direct interaction of specific intracellular metabolites and RNA sequences. Here we show that an analogous RNA-based gene regulation system can effectively be designed for mammalian cells via the incorporation of sequences encoding self-cleaving RNA motifs into the transcriptional unit of a gene or vector. When correctly positioned, the sequences lead to potent inhibition of gene or vector expression, owing to the spontaneous cleavage of the RNA transcript. Administration of either oligonucleotides complementary to regions of the self-cleaving motif or a specific small molecule results in the efficient induction of gene expression, owing to inhibition of self-cleavage of the messenger RNA. Efficient regulation of transgene expression is shown in a variety of mammalian cell lines and live animals. In conjunction with other emerging technologies, this methodology may be particularly applicable to the development of gene regulation systems tailored to any small inducer molecule, and provide a novel means of biological sensing in vivo that may have an important application in the regulated delivery of protein therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an effective treatment for several lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). Intravenously infused enzymes are taken up by tissues through either the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) or the mannose receptor (MR). It is generally believed that M6PR-mediated endocytosis is a key mechanism for ERT in treating LSDs that affect the non-macrophage cells of visceral organs. However, the therapeutic efficacy of MR-mediated delivery of mannose-terminated enzymes in these diseases has not been fully evaluated. We tested the effectiveness of a non-phosphorylated α-galactosidase A produced from moss (referred to as moss-aGal) in vitro and in a mouse model of Fabry disease. Endocytosis of moss-aGal was MR-dependent. Compared to agalsidase alfa, a phosphorylated form of α-galactosidase A, moss-aGal was more preferentially targeted to the kidney. Cellular localization of moss-aGal and agalsidase alfa in the heart and kidney was essentially identical. A single injection of moss-aGal led to clearance of accumulated substrate in the heart and kidney to an extent comparable to that achieved by agalsidase alfa. This study suggested that mannose-terminated enzymes may be sufficiently effective for some LSDs in which non-macrophage cells are affected, and that M6P residues may not always be a prerequisite for ERT as previously considered.},

Therefore, we characterized thermodynamically the ligand binding properties of a synthetic, tetracycline (tc)-binding RNA aptamer, which regulates gene expression in a dose-dependent manner when inserted into the untranslated region of an mRNA. In vitro, one molecule of tc is bound by one molecule of partially pre-structured and conformationally homogeneous apo-RNA. The dissociation constant of 770 pM, as determined by fluorimetry, is the lowest reported so far for a small molecule-binding RNA aptamer. Additional calorimetric analysis of RNA point mutants and tc derivatives identifies functional groups crucial for the interaction and including their respective enthalpic and entropic contributions we can propose detailed structural and functional roles for certain groups. The conclusions are consistent with mutational analyses in vivo and support the hypothesis that tc-binding reinforces the structure of the RNA aptamer, preventing the scanning ribosome from melting it efficiently.},

This approach uses multiple-sequence alignments, atomic-resolution structural information, and riboswitch gene associations. Among the discoveries are unique variants of the guanine riboswitch class that most tightly bind the nucleoside 2′-deoxyguanosine. In addition, we identified variants of the glycine riboswitch class that no longer recognize this amino acid, additional members of a rare flavin mononucleotide (FMN) variant class, and also variants of c-di-GMP-I and -II riboswitches that might recognize different bacterial signaling molecules. These findings further reveal the diverse molecular sensing capabilities of RNA, which highlights the potential for discovering a large number of additional natural riboswitch classes.},

By extending sgRNAs to include modified riboswitches that recognize specific signals, we can create CRISPR–Cas9-based 'signal conductors' that regulate transcription of endogenous genes in response to external or internal signals of interest. These devices can be used to construct all the basic types of Boolean logic gates that perform logical signal operations in mammalian cells without needing the layering of multiple genetic circuits. They can also be used to rewire cellular signaling events by constructing synthetic links that couple different signaling pathways. Moreover, this approach can be applied to redirect oncogenic signal transduction by controlling simultaneous bidirectional (ON–OFF) gene transcriptions, thus enabling reprogramming of the fate of cancer cells.},

After randomizing a previously selected ribozyme ligase, L1, we selected variants that required one of two protein cofactors, a tyrosyl transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetase (Cyt18) or hen egg white lysozyme. The resulting nucleoprotein enzymes were activated several thousand fold by their cognate protein effectors, and could specifically recognize the structures of the native proteins. Protein-dependent ribozymes can potentially be adapted to novel assays for detecting target proteins, and the selection method's generality may allow the high-throughput identification of ribozymes capable of recognizing a sizable fraction of a proteome.},

We investigate how selection for high-affinity aptamers is constrained by chemical properties of the ligand and the need to bind in low magnesium. We select two sets of RNA aptamers that bind planar ligands with dissociation constants (Kds) ranging from 65 nM to 100 μM in physiological buffer conditions. Aptamers selected to bind the non-proteinogenic amino acid, p-amino phenylalanine (pAF), are larger and more informationally complex (i.e., rarer in a pool of random sequences) than aptamers selected to bind a larger fluorescent dye, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR). Interestingly, tighter binding aptamers show less dependence on magnesium than weaker-binding aptamers. Thus, selection for high-affinity binding may automatically lead to structures that are functional in physiological conditions (1–2.5 mM Mg2+). We hypothesize that selection for high-affinity binding in physiological conditions is primarily constrained by ligand characteristics such as molecular weight (MW) and the number of rotatable bonds. We suggest that it may be possible to estimate aptamer–ligand affinities and predict whether a particular aptamer-based design goal is achievable before performing the selection.},

Here, we demonstrate that the settings of plate reader assays have a significant impact on bacterial growth, recombinant gene expression, and biofilm formation. Furthermore, we show that the plate reader settings affect the apparent activity, sensitivity, and chemical kinetics of synthetic constructs, as well as alter the apparent effectiveness of antibiotics. Our results suggest the critical need for consistent reporting of plate reader protocols to ensure the reproducibility of the protocols.

The CRISPR-associated catalytically inactive dCas9 protein offers a general platform for RNA-guided DNA targeting. Here we show that fusion of dCas9 to effector domains with distinct regulatory functions enables stable and efficient transcriptional repression or activation in human and yeast cells with the site of delivey determined solely by a co-expressed short guide (sg)RNA. Coupling of dCas9 to a transcriptional repressor domain can robustly silence expression of multiple endogenous genes RNA-seq analysis indicates that CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-mediated transcriptional repression is highly specific. Our results establish that the CRISPR system can be used as a modular and flexible DNA-binding platform for the recruitment of proteins to a target DNA sequence and reveal the potential of CRISPRi as a general tool for the precise regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.},

	abstract = {Previous in vitro selection experiments identified an RNA aptamer that recognizes the chromophore malachite green (MG) with a high level of affinity, and which undergoes site-specific cleavage following laser irradiation. To understand the mechanism by which this RNA folds to recognize specifically its ligand and the structural basis for chromophore-assisted laser inactivation, we have determined the 2.8 Å crystal structure of the aptamer bound to tetramethylrosamine (TMR), a high-affinity MG analog. The ligand-binding site is defined by an asymmetric internal loop, flanked by a pair of helices. A U-turn and several non-canonical base interactions stabilize the folding of loop nucleotides around the TMR. The aptamer utilizes several tiers of stacked nucleotides arranged in pairs, triples, and a novel base quadruple to effectively encapsulate the ligand. Even in the absence of specific stabilizing hydrogen bonds, discrimination between related fluorophores and chromophores is possible due to tight packing in the RNA binding pocket, which severely limits the size and shape of recognized ligands. The site of laser-induced cleavage lies relatively far from the bound TMR (∼15 Å). The unusual backbone conformation of the cleavage site nucleotide and its high level of solvent accessibility may combine to allow preferential reaction with freely diffusing hydroxyl radicals generated at the bound ligand. Several observations, however, favor alternative mechanisms for cleavage, such as conformational changes in the aptamer or long-range electron transfer between the bound ligand and the cleavage site nucleotide.},

Developing artificial genetic switches in order to control gene expression via an external stimulus is an important aim in chemical and synthetic biology. Here, we expand the application range of RNA switches to the regulation of 16S rRNA function in Escherichia coli. For this purpose, we incorporated hammerhead ribozymes at several positions into orthogonalized 16S rRNA. We observed that ribosomal function is remarkably tolerant toward the incorporation of large additional RNA fragments at certain sites of the 16S rRNA. However, ribozyme-mediated cleavage results in severe reduction of 16S rRNA stability. We carried out an in vivo screen for the identification of sequences acting as ligand-responsive RNA switches, enabling thiamine-dependent switching of 16S rRNA function. In addition to expanding the regulatory toolbox, the presented artificial riboswitches should prove valuable to study aspects of rRNA folding and stability in bacteria.},

In addition, this traditional purification method is not amenable to studies demanding high-throughput RNA production. Recently, we presented the first general method for producing almost any RNA sequence that employs an affinity tag that is removed during the purification process. Because technical difficulties prevented application of this method to many RNAs, we have developed an improved version that utilizes a different activatable ribozyme and affinity tag that are considerably more robust, rapid, and broadly applicable.},

Aptamer-controlled hammerhead ribozymes (so-called aptazymes) have been shown to be a versatile platform for the engineering of novel gene regulators. Since aptazymes are cis-acting elements that are located in the untranslated regions of a gene of interest, their application does not need any further protein co-factor. This presents the opportunity to simplify complex gene networks while simultaneously expanding the repertoire of available parts. Nevertheless, the generation of novel aptazymes requires a functional aptamer–ribozyme connection, which can be difficult to engineer. This article describes a novel approach for using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) in order to identify functional aptazymes in bacteria and their subsequent transfer into mammalian cells.},

We posited, based on prior structural information, that anion–aromatic interactions between the anionic Asp general base and Phe54 and Phe116 might be used instead of a hydrogen-bond network to position the general base in the active site of ketosteroid isomerase from Comamonas testosteroni as there are no neighboring hydrogen-bonding groups. We have tested the role of the Phe residues using site-directed mutagenesis, double-mutant cycles, and high-resolution X-ray crystallography. These results indicate a catalytic role of these Phe residues. Extensive analysis of the Protein Data Bank provides strong support for a catalytic role of these and other Phe residues in providing anion–aromatic interactions that position anionic general bases within enzyme active sites. Our results further reveal a potential selective advantage of Phe in certain situations, relative to more traditional hydrogen-bonding groups, because it can simultaneously aid in the binding of hydrophobic substrates and positioning of a neighboring general base.},

	abstract = {Genetic selection provides the most powerful method to assay large libraries of biomolecules for function. However, harnessing the power of genetic selection for the detection of specific, nonendogenous small-molecule targets in vivo remains a significant challenge. The ability to genetically select for small molecules would provide a reaction-independent mechanism to clone biosynthesis genes from large DNA libraries and greatly facilitate the exploration of large libraries of mutant enzymes for improved synthetic capabilities including altered substrate specificities and enhanced regio- or stereoselectivities. While remarkable progress has been made in developing genetic methods to detect small molecules in vivo, many of these methods rely on engineering small-moleculeprotein interactions which remains a difficult problem, and the potential for some of these systems to assay large libraries is limited by the low transformation efficiency and long doubling time of yeast relative to bacteria. Herein, we demonstrate that synthetic riboswitches that activate protein translation in response to a specific small molecule can be used to perform sensitive genetic screens and selections for the presence of small molecules in Escherichia coli. We further demonstrate that the exquisite molecular discrimination properties of aptamers selected in vitro translate directly into an in vivo genetic selection system. Finally, we demonstrate that a cell harboring a synthetic riboswitch with a particular ligand specificity can be selectively amplified from a million-fold larger pool of cells containing mutant riboswitches that respond to a closely related ligand, suggesting that it is possible to use genetic selection in E. coli to discover synthetic riboswitches with new ligand specificities from libraries of mutant riboswitches.},

In vitro selection is the experimental process by which large random-sequence pools of RNA or DNA are used as the starting point to identify particular nucleic acid sequences that have desired functions. When this function is binding of a molecular target, the functional nucleic acid is an RNA or DNA “aptamer.” When this function is catalysis of a chemical reaction, the functional nucleic acid is a “ribozyme” or “deoxyribozyme”; these are collectively termed “nucleic acid enzymes.” Since the first in vitro selection experiments in 1990, a wide variety of aptamers and nucleic acid enzymes have been identified. This chapter describes how aptamers, ribozymes, and deoxyribozymes are obtained by in vitro selection methodologies. Also addressed are the scope of the molecular targets that are bound and the chemical reactions that are catalyzed. Biochemical and structural characterizations of aptamers and nucleic acid enzymes are discussed. A final section introduces aptazymes, which are allosterically regulated nucleic acid enzymes.},

By engineering photoswitchable azobenzene-based molecules into the structure, light-triggered changes in interatomic distances in the azobenzene moiety are able to drive large-scale conformational changes of the protein assembly. The different states of the assembly can be visualized with single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, and the nanocages can be used to capture and release non-native cargos.

Addition of ligands to the bacterial growth medium changes the activity of the ligand-dependent self-cleaving ribozyme which in turn switches gene expression. In this chapter, we describe the in vivo screening procedure allowing for reprogramming the ligand-specificity of our system.},

	abstract = {In a continuing effort to explore structural and functional dynamics in RNA catalysis, we have created a series of allosteric hammerhead ribozymes that are activated by theophylline. Representative ribozymes exhibit greater than 3000-fold activation upon effector-binding and cleave with maximum rate constants that are equivalent to the unmodified hammerhead ribozyme. In addition, we have evolved a variant allosteric ribozyme that exhibits an effector specificity change from theophylline to 3-methylxanthine. Molecular discrimination between the two effectors appears to be mediated by subtle conformational differences that originate from displacement of the phosphodiester backbone near the effector binding pocket. These findings reveal the importance of abstruse aspects of molecular recognition by nucleic acids that are likely to be unapproachable by current methods of rational design.},

	abstract = {Prior site-directed mutagenesis studies in bacterial ketosteroid isomerase (KSI) reported that substitution of both oxyanion hole hydrogen bond donors gives a 105- to 108-fold rate reduction, suggesting that the oxyanion hole may provide the major contribution to KSI catalysis. But these seemingly conservative mutations replaced the oxyanion hole hydrogen bond donors with hydrophobic side chains that could lead to suboptimal solvation of the incipient oxyanion in the mutants, thereby potentially exaggerating the apparent energetic benefit of the hydrogen bonds relative to water-mediated hydrogen bonds in solution. We determined the functional and structural consequences of substituting the oxyanion hole hydrogen bond donors and several residues surrounding the oxyanion hole with smaller residues in an attempt to create a local site that would provide interactions more analogous to those in aqueous solution. These more drastic mutations created an active-site cavity estimated to be ∼650 Å3 and sufficient for occupancy by 15–17 water molecules and led to a rate decrease of only ∼103-fold for KSI from two different species, a much smaller effect than that observed from more traditional conservative mutations. The results underscore the strong context dependence of hydrogen bond energetics and suggest that the oxyanion hole provides an important, but moderate, catalytic contribution relative to the interactions in the corresponding solution reaction.},
