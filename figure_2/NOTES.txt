Fig 1a is not really crucial to the point I want to make, which is that we used 
directed evolution to get working sensors.   It's certainly important to know 
what the system is, but I can describe that in the text and put this panel in 
the supplement.  The thing I'd miss most is the introduction of G1, G2, R1, and 
R2.  But that can also happen in the text or the caption, and you can still get 
the main gist of the figure without them.
