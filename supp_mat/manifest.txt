*in vitro* data
===============
[ ] Results for 100 in vitro designs.

    That was a screen.  I only did everything once, and I'm not going to go 
    back and repeat it now.  I'll try to put this together and see how much 
    effort it'll take.

[ ] In vitro designs in vivo.

    I have this data, but the 3 replicates were all done on the same day.  And 
    they're done in the context of the standard sgRNA backbone, not the 
    optimized one.  The context is fine; that's what the in vitro designs are.  
    But the same-day replicates artificially lower the error bars, which is 
    important for this figure, and make this data look much less noisy than all 
    my other data.

Bacterial data
==============
[ ] Populations during screens

[ ] James' ligand matrix

[ ] J23150 data

[ ] double-target data

[ ] Liu data

[ ] ViennaRNA predictions

[ ] Titration traces

[ ] Good gel for 11,30,37 (any spacer; maybe d1?)

Mammalian data
==============
[ ] Include both PDFs from Christof

[ ] Also include my in vitro data?  I'd have to replicate it.  And do a better 
    job making the RNA.

Yeast data
==========
[ ] Don't have it, need to hassle Ben and Andrew for it.
