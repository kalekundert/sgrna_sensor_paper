*in vitro* data
===============
[ ] Results for 100 in vitro designs.
    \refsuptab{rational-designs}

    That was a screen.  I only did everything once, and I'm not going to go 
    back and repeat it now.  I'll try to put this together and see how much 
    effort it'll take.

[ ] In vitro designs in vivo.
    \refsupfig{in-vitro-in-vivo}

    I have this data, but the 3 replicates were all done on the same day.  And 
    they're done in the context of the standard sgRNA backbone, not the 
    optimized one.  The context is fine; that's what the in vitro designs are.  
    But the same-day replicates artificially lower the error bars, which is 
    important for this figure, and make this data look much less noisy than all 
    my other data.

Bacterial data
==============
[ ] Library sequences
